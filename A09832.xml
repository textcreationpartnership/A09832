            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:15198:10"/>
&amp; that they onely are the cauſe why men with equall and indifferent mindes ſuffer the varietie and change of Fortune, takyng example at other mens damage: waying theſe thyngs I thought none would iudge it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to recite them againe, whiche haue bene inculcate of ſo many, ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affecting this kinde of learning, eſpecially not of me, bycauſe the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie and ſtrangeneſſe of the matter which I determine and deliberate to intreate vpon, is of efficacie and force inough to drawe the mindes bothe of yong and olde, to the reading and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent digeſting of this my worke. For what man is there ſo diſpiſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or any ſo idle and ſlouthfull to be found, which will eſchue or auoide by what policies, or by what kinde of gouernment the moſt part of nations in the vniuerſall world were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſubdued, and in ſpace of thrée and fiftie yeares made ſubiect and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which before that time

For who is there ſo ſtudiouſly bent, eyther that hath ſuch an erneſt affection or zeale to other diſcipline or ſtudie, that hée ſuppoſeth any kynde of knowledge to be of more value, either worthy to be eſtéemed or preferred before this? But the antiquitie &amp; worthineſſe of this my worke, ſhalbe more manifeſt, if the ſoueraigntie &amp; ſeignorie of thoſe men that flouriſhed in ſo great glorie and dignitie, of the which the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers haue written at large, ſhould be compared to the excellencie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire: &amp; aboue other theſe are moſt worthy, for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> in auncient tyme were of greate power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, of maruellous might &amp; riches notwithſtanding as oft as they paſſed the bounds &amp; lymits of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they not onely douted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perdition of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of their owne lyues.

for the Regiment of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: And at the laſt hauing obtained their heartes deſire, they could ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kepe it twelue yeares in tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie &amp; quietneſſe without great grief, trouble and vexations. The <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had the ſoueraignetie ouer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine partes of <hi>Europa,</hi> from <hi>Adria,</hi> to the greate riuer <hi>Isther,</hi> which is but a ſmal portion of that region: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hauing vanquiſhed and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they enioyed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie of al <hi>Aſia.</hi> Theſe alſo though they ruled ouer ſundry natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, yet they left a great part of the worlde vnconquered: for they neuer endeuoured them ſelues to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <hi>Sicilia, Sardinia,</hi> or <hi>Affrica,</hi> &amp; ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euer heard they tel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other fierce &amp; vntractable Nations which inhabite towardes the <hi>Ponent,</hi> or weſt parts.

Concerning the facts of the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Affricans,</hi> at the warres betwixt the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes,</hi> commonly called the battaile of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> for theſe conſequently doe depende of thoſe which are laſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Sicionius.</hi> Before this time ther were many batailes fought in ſundrie places: but afterward it chanced that the hiſtorie increaſed and augmented ſo, that it came (as it wer) into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: for the ſtate and condition of the <hi>Italians,</hi> was mixte and intermingled with the <hi>Libians, Grecians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15198:12"/>
ſo that they all tend &amp; belong to one matter and ende, for the which cauſe &amp; haue made and taken the beginning of my worke from this time. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Romanes</hi> in that battayle had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and vanquiſhed the <hi>Carthagmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> they ſuppoſed the chief and worſt part to be paſſed, and therfore thought they might better venter to atchieue the whole: euen at that preſent they were imboldened to take in hand the conqueſt of the reſt, attempting to ſayle with theyr whole ſtrength and power into <hi>Grecia</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> But if we once perfectly vnderſtoode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cuſtomes, ordinances &amp; faſhions of them which labored and trauayled for atchieuing the rule and dominion of the worlde, peraduenture it ſhould not be requiſit any preciſelyer to repete by what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or puiſſance, eyther by what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement they were animated to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte ſuch an enterpriſe. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the olde maners, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and faſhions, eyther of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15198:12"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> were knowen to the moſte parte of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> I ſuppoſed it requiſite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in this booke, and in the nexte, to diſcloſe theyr power and abylitie, with the famous actes done by them, before I enter into the Hiſtorie, leaſt by chaunce ſome man preparing and indeuoring him ſelfe to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this worke, might be in doute by what counſaile or power, eyther by what great hope the <hi>Romanes</hi> were perſuaded to the Conqueſte of the whole Worlde, and domination of our Seas ſince, in this my beginning and preparation, all men may cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue and vnderſtande, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſtore and plentie enough of all neceſſaryes, to the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of ſuch a conqueſt, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of theyr pretenſed purpoſe. This alſo is the chief and principall beautifying of any worke wyth the famous and worthy actes perpetrate
<pb facs="tcp:15198:13"/>
in this time, that as Fortune hath cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed all things done through the moſte parte of the world to tend and belong to one ende and ſcope, ſo that likewiſe in one Hiſtory or Chronicle, they may well be written &amp; compriſed. Which thing chiefly incoraged me to take this Hiſtorie in hand, and ſo much the rather bicauſe no man before this my time hath attempted to commit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> factes perpetrate in the vniuerſall and whole worlde, for then wolde not I haue attempted thys en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. But euery one particularly hath mencioned and penned certaine particular warres, with the facts done in them: but of a coniunct commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things done vniuerſally, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their beginnings, or for what cauſe they began, or what ende they had, there is none as far as I can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that hathe written to theſe dayes. I thought it expedient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that this my work ſhoulde come abroade into the handes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15198:13"/>
of my countreymen, being politike &amp; eloquente fellowes to entreate of the moſt famous renomed and profitable facts of Fortune, which although ſhe hath wroughte many wonderful, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and notable acts in the dayes of diuers men, worthy of admiration, yet hath ſhe wrought nothyng which exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth, yea or that are to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with theſe in our dayes: Whiche worthie acts can not be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, by reuoluing the writers of priuate Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, vnleſſe there chaunce to bée ſome ſuch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which paſſyng by a gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and brauely builded citie, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the parts therof drawn forth, incontinently ſuppoſeth that he hath a perfecte knowledge of the ſituation, ſigure, and courſe of the vniuerſall worlde, which is incongruent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And verily as I iudge, they no leſſe erre and diſſent from the truthe, which thinke by readyng a particular or priuate hiſtorie to obtaine the exact knowledge of the vniuerſal, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:15198:14"/>
which beholding the partes of a liuely and beautifull bodie diſperpled and ſeperate into ſundry members, and thinke them ſelues perfectly to know the good ſhape and feture of the ſame ioyned together. But if a man would take and vnite the diſtincte ſeperate and ſeuered partes, ſetting them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theyr due diſpoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction and perfectneſſe, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhew it them againe, vndouted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would confeſſe to haue erred &amp; gon aſtray like to one in a dreame, for it is poſſible that ſeing the ſeperate parts, they might conceiue a certaine imagination, but to obtaine a ſure knowledge, it is impoſſible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well gather, that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hiſtorie is nothing to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the knowledge of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, in the reuoluing of which, it is impoſſible that a man ſhall not take both ſwéet profit and wonderfull pleaſure, by reaſon of the varietie and worthineſſe of matter contained
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15198:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therin.</p>
            <p>This booke ſhall begin at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation of the <hi>Romanes</hi> out of <hi>Italye,</hi> which conſequently foloweth thoſe things that were laſt written by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi> and was the hundreth twenty &amp; nynth <hi>Olimpiad.</hi> But now it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that I diſcloſe how &amp; at what time the <hi>Italyans</hi> prepared and made them ſelues ready to take ſhippe into <hi>Scicilia,</hi> alſo with what ſtrength and puiſſance they attempted that voiage which was the firſt land that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without <hi>Italye,</hi> after they hadde appeaſed the ciuill diſcorde, domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſſention, and bloudy warres in theyr owne country. Alſo the original of this profection, muſt be explaned wythout obſcuritie or diſſimulation, leaſt in fetching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe too farre, the entrance and beginning be made am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous or doutful.

the repeating of theſe things, it were, expedient that the actes done in them ſhoulde be briefly diſcourſed.

violated the couenant of truce, inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Citie, thruſting out the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and inhabitants, cruelly murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, ſeaſing theyr wyues and children, euery man as he chaunced, in the conflict and tumult, then they ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſled and deuided the ryches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with the pleaſant paſtures and fertil ſoyle amongſt them.

Not long before that time there was a ſedition ſprong vp betwene the <hi>Scici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſouldiers, &amp; the gouernours of the Weale publike, in ſo much that they conſtituted captains ouer them of the <hi>Artemidans</hi> (and him which afterward was their king (one named <hi>Hyeron,</hi> a very yong man, being but a ſtripling and of yong yeares, but ſo furniſhed and indued with all the giftes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as knowledge, vertue, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he wanted nothing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning or neceſſary to a king, except onely a kingdome. When he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15198:18"/>
the authoritie and regiment of the Souldiours, at the length being enuironed with a great troupe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his friends, he entred the citie and toke diuers of the Citizens which were confederats of the rebellion, the which victory he vſed ſo moderately &amp; mercifully, that all the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> with one voyce and conſente (which was a rare thing almoſt neuer ſéene before that time) proclaimed him the ſeconde time gouernour and ruler ouer them. Then <hi>Hyeron</hi> as he ſhewed by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt arguments, deliberated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be of greater and hygher eſtimation than a Captaine. But firſt of all he weyed &amp; conſidered with him ſelfe how the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> were eftſones accuſtomed immediately after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Captaine and the army from the Citie, to kindle vprores and ſeditions, therefore perceyuing the honeſty and fidelitie of <hi>Leptinus,</hi> alſo of what authoritie, credence, and eſtimation hee was of amongeſt the
<pb facs="tcp:15198:19"/>
               <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> and of howe much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and power amongſt the inferior ſorte, he thought it not incongruent to ioyne himſelf vnto him by affinitie, that he mighte haue on to liue in the citie, when he with his armie ſhoulde bée occupied in other affaires. Thus hauing maried the daughter of <hi>Lepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and knit friendſhyp with <hi>Hymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> knots, perceyuing howe the olde <hi>Syracuſan</hi> ſeruiters, which were hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and conduct ſouldiers, wer very vnſtable fickle &amp; ful of mutabilitie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſirous of newe thyngs and changes, he prepared an armie againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which kept <hi>Meſſana,</hi> pit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching his tents and pauilions, placing the front of his battaile along the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the <hi>Ciamoſsians.</hi> Then he tooke both the horſemen and footemen of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> as though he would aſſault his enimies at ſome other place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring an other waye with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, conducting them ſafe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damage into the Citie, ſuffering
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15198:19"/>
the raſcall and hired ſouldiers to bée enuironned and incloſed wyth their enimies, ſo that they were broughte to ruine and vtter confuſion. When he had by this meanes diſpatched the olde ſeruiters out of the Citie, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared &amp; waged ſouldiers of more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſtabilitie. Thus hauing ſet all things in a good and reaſonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and perceiuing the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to aduaunce and boaſt them ſelues, alſo to be proude and arrogant of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer victorie, ſo that they dyd al things vnaduiſedly, fooliſhly, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, like vndiſcrete and harebraine fooles, he with his ſouldiers and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of exerciſed &amp; trained Citizens, departed from the Citie, comming to the fielde <hi>Nileum,</hi> with a quicke and ſwift progreſſion, where he fought a terrible fight along the bankes of the riuer <hi>Longanus,</hi> with the <hi>Campanes,</hi> in which he vanquiſhed them, and tooke their capitaine. Nowe perceiuing the fooliſh hardineſſe and braynſicke bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:15198:20"/>
of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to be repreſſed in this victorie, he returned wyth the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> where with one voice and common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the people, he was proclaimed Kyng. The <hi>Mamertines</hi> firſt of all as I ſaide before, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions helpe, then greuouſly afflicted and troubled with this ouerthrow, were almoſt vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſcoraged, the moſt parte fled to the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> yelding themſelues and their fortreſſes into their handes. An other company ſente Legates to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> notifying them that they wold yelde their fortreſſe with all the munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s belonging, into their hands, requiring them to aſſiſt them as their owne countreymen. The <hi>Romanes</hi> a great tracte of time, determined wyth themſelues what was beſt to be done, for they iudged it very abſurde, fooliſh, &amp; contrary to reaſon, that they which a little before had ſo cruelly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their owne citizens for betraying <hi>Rhegia,</hi> and falſifying theyr truthe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15198:20"/>
nowe to ayde, ſuccoure, or helpe the <hi>Mamertines</hi> which were culpable of the lyke offence. But when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> hadde not only ſuppreſſed with violence and force <hi>Africa,</hi> but alſo the moſte parte of <hi>Spayne,</hi> with all the Ilandes of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi> and the Sea <hi>Tirrhenum,</hi> they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their neighborhode, which thing woulde ſone be brought to paſſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſente ſuccoure and helpe to the <hi>Mamertines. Meſſana</hi> being once taken, which by dyuers was offered them as I declared before, there was no daunger in recouering the reſte of the <hi>Siracuſans,</hi> eſpecially bycauſe all other partes of <hi>Scicily</hi> were vnder their gouernance and power. When the <hi>Romanes</hi> had throughly pondered theſe thinges, they ſuppoſed that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and conſtraint they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled &amp; enforced to ayde, relieue and defende <hi>Meſſana,</hi> not permitting in any caſe that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> ſhould edifie themſelues as it were a bridge,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:21"/>
by the which they might haue frée paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to enter <hi>Italy</hi> at their pleaſure. Yet this matter was long in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, and in concluſion perceyuing it more diſhoneſt than co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious, the Senatours proroged and diſmiſſed it without any reſolute determination. The people of <hi>Rome,</hi> being defatigate and wearied with long warre, nowe were in reſt and quietneſſe, ſo that for lacke of their accuſtomed wages they were ſore impoueriſhed, ſo that they ſhewing to their captaines, the profite which ſhould enſue by aiding them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently it was concluded to ioyne with the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> whiche decrée was corroborate by the aſſente of the comminaltie, ſo that <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of the Conſuls, was elected to con duct an armie into <hi>Scicilie</hi> in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The <hi>Campanes</hi> being certified of their comming, partely with terrour and threatnings, partely with ſubtile ſleightes and deceiptes, ertruded the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> captaine out of the citie,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15198:21"/>
whiche before they had receiued, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> vnto them yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the Citie into his tuition. The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the Prefect of the munition, hanging hym vpon a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, bicauſe thorough his daſtardly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlyneſſe they had loſte the Citie, and incontinentely with all celeritie they leuied an armye, rygging theyr nauie along <hi>Pelorus,</hi> pytchyng theyr tentes aboute <hi>Meſſana,</hi> circumſpectly beſieging the Citie <hi>Hieron,</hi> ſuppoſing at this inſtant a moſt fitte occaſion to be offered for baniſhyng the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> out of <hi>Scicilie,</hi> which kept <hi>Meſſana,</hi> toke truce with the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> and then wyth the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> pitched his tentes by the mount <hi>Galchidicum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieuing the <hi>Mamertines</hi> of that iſſue. Now the Conſull which with greate trouble and perillous dangers hadde paſſed the ſea by night, was arriued at <hi>Meſſana,</hi> wher ſeing the enimies with great ſtrength inuading the citie both by water and lande very ſharply and
<pb facs="tcp:15198:22"/>
vehemently, ſuppoſing it to be very daungerous and nothyng honorable, diſmiſſed certayne Embaſſadours to either of his enimies campes, aſſaying to deliuer the <hi>Mamertines</hi> with qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, all warre and ſtrife appeaſed. But perceiuing that neither of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries wold giue eare to the words of the embaſſage, and in the ende be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to danger himſelf, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined firſt to encounter and contend with the <hi>Siracuſans.</hi> Then he began to order hys Souldiours, imbattayling and placing his forefronts againſt <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eron,</hi> giuing vnto them diuers exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, during which time the <hi>Siracuſan</hi> Captaine made no leſſe preparaunce. This conflicte continued a long time very ſharpe and terrible, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance the <hi>Romanes</hi> had the victory, where hauing ſlaine many of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, boldly purſued the kyng into his pauilion, then the Conſull hauing ſpoyled and rifled the deade bodies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Citie with his hoſte. Nowe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15198:22"/>
               <hi>Hyeron</hi> miſtruſting all thinges, in the night folowing departed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the <hi>Scicilian</hi> army. <hi>Appius</hi> in the nexte morning perceyuing theyr departure intended to purſue them, and muſteringe his Souldiours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that they ſhold looke to their woundes, and prouide for the purſuite of their enimies againſt the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: ſo in the dawning of the day he ſet forward, and coaping with his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, deuoured parte with the ſword, cauſing the reſt to beſtow themſelues in villages adiacent. Thus hauing raiſed the ſiege without interruption, he made diuers incurſions, inuading the groundes of the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> &amp; others bordering nigh, foraging and ranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and depopulating their goods, and in the ende beſieging them. This was the firſt profection y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Romanes</hi> made out of <hi>Italy</hi> for the cauſes preceding, at the which chiefly I toke my beginning bicauſe I thought it a moſt apt &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beginning of this my work, repea
<pb facs="tcp:15198:23"/>
thoſe things ſomwhat exactlier which were thought neceſſary, leſt I ſhould pretermitte any doubtes, in explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng the cauſes. For I ſuppoſed it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be reueled how the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtode in greate danger and diſtreſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in ieopardie of loſing their owne citie. Alſo after what maner hauing recouered <hi>Italy</hi> again, they attempted to ſubdue foraine nations. Alſo I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged it very neceſſary to declare the excellencie and magnificencie of their Empire, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the floriſhing eſtate which it came to afterward, might be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter credited, by the true knowledge of their original. Wherfore if it chaunce the ſequele of this my woorke, when I come to ſpeake of famous Cities, that I digreſſe in ſhewyng any thyng exactlier than the matter is thought to require, let no man wonder at it, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I doe it to that ende and purpoſe, that my narration may be ſuch, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may preciſely knowe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly vnderſtande howe and by what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15198:23"/>
meanes euery one came to that ſtate in which they are at this preſent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I haue done of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But nowe the time requireth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit theſe things, and that I ſhould returne to my incepted purpoſe, and that whiche I intended in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, firſt compendiouſly ſhewyng thoſe things whiche were done before the times that I intende to mencion of. Of whiche the battaile foughte in <hi>Scicilia</hi> betwixte the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> is the firſte. Then the <hi>Punike</hi> or ciuile warre in the which is conteined the facts of <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball,</hi> with the other thinges perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate by the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> deſcending to thoſe times in which the <hi>Romanes</hi> made their firſt exploit into <hi>Illiria</hi> and the other partes of <hi>Europa.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I muſt entreate of the conflictes and contentions betwixt the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> which wer in <hi>Italy</hi> at that time. Alſo of the warre called <hi>Cleomonicum</hi> which was at that preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:15198:24"/>
amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to the which all theſe my circumſtaunces belonge. For it is not neceſſary for me to ſpeke of euery particular thinge, neyther ſhould it be profitable to the Readers, or delectable to the hearers hereof. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I purpoſed not to write any hiſtory of them, but ſummarily to touch thoſe thinges whych are neceſſarie to the knowledge of theſe I haue in hande. Wherefore I will ouerrun them as briefly as is poſſible, endeuouring my ſelfe to conioyne the ende of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the beginning of this work, for by the continuation and hanging together of them and my narration, I ſuppoſe moſt ſincerely to touch theſe things, whych other writers haue written, and alſo to prepare a very facile and ready way to the true knowledge of this hiſtory. But before we make any further progreſſion, it is my pleaſure and fantaſy, more aduiſedly, and in an ampler ſorte to intreat of the warres made by the <hi>Romanes</hi> againſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:15198:24"/>
for the domination of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> bicauſe there hath no battayle ben ſéene of more continuance, that had more preparance made for it, either that conteyned more famous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes, eyther ſo terrible conflictes, or more varietie &amp; chaunge of chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At that time both the countreys were like in ſtrength and puiſſance, of a reaſonable abilitie. Wherefore if any conſider the ſtrength and power of both the cities and Empires, he ſhal vnderſtand that in no other warrs or time after that they might be ſo well reſembled. This alſo ſpecially perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, enforced and pricked me forward to write of this warre, bicauſe thoſe which are thought to haue pende it moſt faithfully, as <hi>Philinus</hi> and <hi>Fabius,</hi> farre diſſente and diſagree from the truthe. But though I dare not ſay they erred willingly and of a ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet I thinke they were decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (as affectoures are accuſtomed) by too much fauouring of theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countrey
<pb facs="tcp:15198:25"/>
men. For <hi>Philinus</hi> writeth by affection and a natural motion, that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> dyd all thyngs lyke ſtrong, valiant, and couragious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Then <hi>Fabius</hi> is in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Diameter quite diſſenting. But I thinke there is none which reprehendeth the reſte of their liues for this, conſidering that it is a good and honeſt mans duetie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fauour his friendes and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſoile, than forayn nations. But it is his duetie which taketh in hand the writing of a hiſtorie, to moderate him ſelfe and abſtaine from all parcialitie, yea oft times to extoll and prayſe hys vtter enimies when by their deſertes they deſerue to be wel ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Other times to reprehend their countreyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and frends when their facts are found woorthie of reprehenſion. For as a beaſt hauing his eies ſcratched out, the reſt of his body is fit for no vſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, ſemblably the vſe of a hiſtorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſified, it is altogether vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Wherfore we muſt neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15198:25"/>
from reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our frends, ne yet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending our enimies, when they merite it, neither is it to be thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ght fooliſh to prayſe thoſe at ſundry ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, conſidering that theſe of whom to ſpeke preſently, could neyther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually conquer victoriouſly, neither is it like that they always toke the foyle. And that theſe things are true which I haue ſpoken, it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thoſe things which <hi>Philinus</hi> hath written. Theſe are his words in the beginning of his ſecond boke. The <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> and the <hi>Siracuſans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Meſſana,</hi> where the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiors arriuing, incontinently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with the <hi>Siracuſans,</hi> of whom they being ouercome, &amp; almoſt put to vtter confuſion, réentred the citie, &amp; atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting an other inſult with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes,</hi> were not onely ſpoyled &amp; put to flight, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Immediatly after theſe, he ſheweth how <hi>Hieron</hi> was ſo affrighted after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> combate, that he not onely fyering his
<pb facs="tcp:15198:26"/>
tents &amp; pauilions fled away by night, but alſo forſoke &amp; left all the ſtrongeſt fortified and well fenced caſtels, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate betwixt <hi>Meſſana</hi> and <hi>Scicilye.</hi> He reporteth alſo how the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> in that conflict were ſo daunted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they for ſooke their tentes, diſperſing them ſelues in the <hi>Scicilian</hi> villages, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardie after that daye to attempt any thing with their armie. Alſo how the Prefects perceiuing the mindes of the people to be ſo diſcouraged, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them no more after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them ſelues to the mutabilitie of Fortune in battaile. He ſheweth alſo how the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes,</hi> not onely waſted, ſpoyled and foraged their prouince and the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans,</hi> but alſo to haue beſieged the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians,</hi> the which things are ſo abſurd, fooliſh and incongruent, that it were vayne &amp; mere foly to perſiſt in their conſultation. For thoſe which a little before beſieged <hi>Meſsana,</hi> and as he ſayde, were conquerers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15198:26"/>
immediatly &amp; without intermiſſion, he declareth how hauing their hearts ſurpriſed with great feare, they fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, lurking in the cotages and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Citie, vntill they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. And thoſe which hardly before were kept in their citie by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes</hi> &amp; foyled in fight, ſtreight way he maketh conquerours, ſpoyling the territoryes of their enimies, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers incurſions, and finally inuading their citie. But theſe by no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can agrée. Wherefore of neceſſitie eyther that which he putteth firſte, or the which he placeth laſt, muſt be falſe &amp; of no effecte. But this is manifeſtly knowne to all men, that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> and <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> after they hadde fledde from theyr tentes, conueyed them ſelues immediatly to the Citie, where without intermiſſion, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> beſieged the <hi>Scicilians,</hi> which proueth and corroborateth his laſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſo that of neceſſitie his firſt aſſertion muſt nedes be falſe, vntrue,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:27"/>
and of no value. For the <hi>Romanes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained victorie in the battaile foughte by <hi>Meſſana.</hi> Yet he fooliſhly fained the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ben vanquiſhed of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes.</hi> Oftentymes of this faſhion erreth <hi>Philinus</hi> incongruentely, and without reaſon: and <hi>Fabius</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I ſhall ſhewe in their places.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to my purpoſe from the whiche I haue ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed by ſhewing theſe things, that thereby the ſtudious affecters of this worke might better perceiue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyaunce of the hiſtorie. When the fame was divulgate &amp; broughte from <hi>Scicilie</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> of the proſperous and fortunate ſucceſſe chaunced to <hi>Appius</hi> &amp; the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Valerius</hi> and <hi>Caius Octacilius</hi> being create Conſulls, were bothe ſent into <hi>Scicilie</hi> with the <hi>Romane</hi> armie, in the which hoſt were foure legions, all <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> by the aides whiche was ſente them yearely by their allies, euery le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conteinyng foure thouſand foote
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15198:27"/>
men and thrée hundreth horſemen. At the arriuall of the Conſulls many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bothe of the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> and the <hi>Syracuſanes</hi> reuolted vnto them. <hi>Hieron</hi> perceiuing the <hi>Scicilians</hi> to bée diſcouraged, alſo the number and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to be augmented, ſuppoſed that their amitie ſhoulde be more commodious to hym than the frendſhip of the <hi>Carthaginenſes:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſmiſſed certaine ambaſſadors to the conſuls to intreat for peace, the <hi>Romans</hi> perceyuing the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> kept the ſeas in euery corner, &amp; beyng afrayd leaſt at any time they ſhold be deſtitute of victuals, they ſuppoſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the friendſhippe of <hi>Hieron,</hi> ſhoulde be very commodious to them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of ſuch caſualties, ſo that they concluded peace with the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> on theſe conditions: That the King ſhold reſtore the captiues whiche he had in priſon to the <hi>Romanes</hi> withoute raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Moreouer, that they ſhould pay an hundreth talentes of money, and
<pb facs="tcp:15198:28"/>
then to be receiued and admitted as friends to the <hi>Romans.</hi> King <hi>Hyeron</hi> hauing gotten him ſelfe thus vnder the protection of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ayded and ſupported them with victuals and other neceſſaries, as oft as neceſſitie required, paſſing the reſt of his life in more happy and fortunate eſtate than any other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Grecians,</hi> ſo that in mine opinion his life was more honorable &amp; renowmed than any of the reſidue, continuing in like eſtate and happie ſucceſſe a great tracte of time bothe in publike and priuate affayres. As ſone as theſe news were publiſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> they condeſcended to them, liking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well the conditions and peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with <hi>Hieron:</hi> after that daye they thought it not neceſſary to ſende their whole ſtrength and power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuppoſing two legions to be ſufficient, bicauſe they thought the warre not ſo perillous the king being aſſociate vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, alſo for that of him they ſhould haue plenty of ſuch things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15198:28"/>
as were neceſſarie to the Army. The <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> perceiuing <hi>Hieron</hi> to be reuolted and become their enimie, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> to haue the greater part of <hi>Italye</hi> in poſſeſſion, ſuppoſed that they neded greater puiſſance to withſtand their force, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wrote to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Ligurian</hi> Captaines &amp; prefectes of the <hi>Gallician</hi> army, alſo to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſouldiers for ayde. Which being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Scicilie,</hi> and perceiuing the citie of <hi>Agrigentine</hi> to be a place very fyt for their purpoſe &amp; ſtrong munition againſt their enimies, bordering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſtored it with great ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of victuals, and vſed it as a warlike munition againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Conſuls hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded peace wyth <hi>Hieron,</hi> voyded out of the Prouince. After their departure, <hi>Lucius Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius &amp; Quintus Aemilius</hi> being elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their places, came into <hi>Italye,</hi> with the army, which hauing diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered the preparation of the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> made about the Citie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Agrigentines,</hi> being of more auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
<pb facs="tcp:15198:29"/>
than theyr predeceſſors, thought it neceſſarie earneſtly to apply theyr matters in <hi>Scicilie.</hi> Wherefore they muſtred all theyr ſouldiours together &amp; inuaded the Citie, incamping them ſelues within eight furlongs of the munition, keping their enimies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citie. Now it was Autumne, &amp; euery man ſuppoſed that the ſiege would continue very long, for which cauſe the ſouldiers left their Campes boldly, laboring ſorer than nede requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to get in their harueſt. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes</hi> ſeing their enimies rouing and wandering abroade here &amp; there in the prouince adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turouſly &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out circumſpection, hadde a good hope that the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions that daye might be vanquiſhed, and eaſely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſo that they ruſhed out with great violence, parte into the tentes and campe, and part amongſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and laborers. But the diuerſitie of maners and orders, as they haue ofte tymes preſerued many, ſo the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15198:29"/>
               <hi>Romans</hi> this daye eſpecially by them were exempt from dangers: for there is a law amongſt them, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the time of warre abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth him ſelfe out of his appointed ſtation, or wandereth out of the Campe, for ſo doing he muſt receiue Martiall law. By the which good order, it fortuned that the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> being a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter multitude and number of men, yet by the noble and valiant reſiſtance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and with the loſſe of many ſouldiers, the <hi>Africans</hi> had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foile, and in the ende were driuen from the Campe and fled away, many of them being ſpoyled in the purſute, and the reſt with greate ioy of their enimies driuen within the walles. Such feare raigned in bothe armyes by the daunger of this day, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> were not bolde ſo raſhely and withoute regarde to enter the campe of their enimies, neyther permitted the <hi>Romanes</hi> their ſouldiers ſo vnaduiſedly to runne on
<pb facs="tcp:15198:30"/>
harueſting. Now when the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> deſiſted any more to vrge their enimies with extern ſkirmiſhes, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely farre off with ſhaftes and dartes, the Conſuls deuided their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into two parts, laying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at the temple of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and incamping y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other on that ſide which lyeth toward <hi>Heraclea,</hi> being the iuſt midſt betwixt the two Armies, they incompaſſed with a double ditch ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Citie, making one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them &amp; the walles of the holde, to defende them from ſodaine inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was alſo a nother diche caſt on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outſide, leaſt the fortreſſe ſhoulde be ſuccored as it often times chanceth to cities beſieged. They fortified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the ditches and the hoaſt, with diuers gariſons of men: victuals and other neceſſaries for the Campe, were brought by the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> into <hi>Erbeſum</hi> from whence the <hi>Romans</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them into their tents, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town was not farre diſtante from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:15198:30"/>
The two Armies laye thus fiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, in the which time nothing was done of eyther part worthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. But in continuance of tyme when hunger &amp; famin began to pinch &amp; nip the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great multitude incloſed in the citie, (for they amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to aboue fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men) then <hi>Annibal</hi> which was ruler of the Citie, altogether miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his matters ſent word to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> to certifie them, not onely how the Citie was beſieged, but alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them of ayde and ſuccour, wyth which newes the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> being moued, they prepared an Army, and collected a great number of Elepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; ſhippes which they ſent to <hi>Hanno,</hi> their other captaine in <hi>Scicilia,</hi> who hauing gathered his men togither, went to <hi>Heraclea,</hi> where he ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things aduiſedly, tooke the Towne of <hi>Erbeſum</hi> by treaſon, with al the victuals &amp; neceſſaries belonging to the hoaſte which vnto that day had
<pb facs="tcp:15198:31"/>
ben the greateſt ſtorer, and chief ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which loſſe it came to paſſe that the Conſuls were as fiercely aſſalted as they did defend, and were ofte brought to that ſtaye through penurie and wante of other neceſſaries, that ſundry tymes they deliberated of diſſoluing theyr camp, which vndoutedly hadde chaunced in continuance, if that <hi>Hyeron</hi> King of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> had not with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence prouided and miniſtred neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things to the hoſt. After this <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> perceiuing the <hi>Romans</hi> to be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſickneſſe &amp; penury, (for there was a great plague in the camp,) and ſeing his ſouldiers very apt and redy for the battaile, gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fiftie Elephants, making all things in a redyneſſe and bringing his power out of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> commaunding the <hi>Numidian</hi> horſmen to marche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ioyning with their enimies to prouoke their horſemen as much as they could to enter the battayle,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15198:31"/>
then they to take their ſlight without ſtaying, vnto ſuch time as they came vnto him. The <hi>Numidians</hi> obeyed the commaundement of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, for at the firſt they ſo prouoked their enimies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> incontinently the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> horſemen ruſhed vpon them very raſhly, the <hi>Libians</hi> according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their Captaine, without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance fled vntill they came to him, at which ſight the <hi>Romans</hi> turned theyr backs, but <hi>Hanno</hi> with his company handled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hotly, killing many &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the reſt into their Campe. This broyle being thus finiſhed, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes</hi> departed with their army &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on a hill called <hi>Torus,</hi> but. x. furlongs diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the army of their enimies, wher they lingered two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths without any enterpriſe, ſauing with ſhooting of arrows and caſting of darts. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time <hi>Annibal</hi> made many ſignes &amp; tokens bothe by meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the famine any longer, &amp; how many of his retinue were reuolted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Romans</hi> for want of ſuſtenance. <hi>Hanno</hi> being moued with theſe newes, imbattailed his men &amp; ſet all things in order. The Conſuls likewiſe, with no leſſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence prepared them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conflict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with the daungers before declared. Bothe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armies were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into an equall place, where they coped together with eager and ſharpe onſets. This conflict continued long very terrible &amp; diſpitefull, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length the <hi>Romans</hi> cauſed the firſt battayle of the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> to recoyle and giue backe, who raſhly &amp; without regarde, braſt in among the Elephants, wyth which the beaſts being afraide, diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted and troubled the whole army, in which broyle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Romans</hi> charged them earneſtly, compelling the <hi>Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> quite to forſake the field. The <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> being proflygate, &amp; in this maner almoſt brought to vtter confuſion, part pauned their liues for ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by it, the remenant fled to <hi>Heraclea.</hi> The

               <hi>Romans</hi> hauing gathered the praie of Elephants and other booties gained of the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> returned with their retinue into their camps.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of all help, &amp; hauing no hope of aide, eſteming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be a moſt coueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time for him &amp; his ſouldiers to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape forth, for the cauſes before reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Romans,</hi> without daunger or interruption, ſtrawing the wayes with chaffe. The <hi>Romans</hi> in the dawning of the next morning percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their enimies to be fled, began a purſute, but incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly retorned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie where their army without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption or reſiſtance aſſailyng the gates, entred within the walles, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; raunſacking all things within
<pb facs="tcp:15198:33"/>
famous towne, ſeaſing &amp; taking great praie of goodes and ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, with other ineſtimable booties, When word was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> how the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> were diſcomforted, &amp; <hi>Agrigentine</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they began to wax inſolent and angry and aſſaying greater things, not being content with thoſe things which they ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the beginning, to ayde the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> &amp; defend <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſana,</hi> for to reſiſt the power of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes</hi> in <hi>Scicilie.</hi> But now hoping after greater principalities, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to expell them quite out of the prouince, ſuppoſing by that meanes of their doings ſhold haue more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſe. Through theſe cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they were moued and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent concerning their exploits in <hi>Scicilye,</hi> knowyng that their foote men were of more proweſſe &amp; worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe than their enimies. After the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation of <hi>Agrigentine, Lucius Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus Octacilius</hi> elected Conſuls, and hauing a great army leuied, were ſent into <hi>Scicilye,</hi> ſo that nowe their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15198:33"/>
ſtrength was equal: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Carthagineſes</hi> had domination ouer the ſeas, ruling euery angle at libertie without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, whych is an euident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that after the ſuppreſſion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grigentine,</hi> many of the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> townes in <hi>Scicilie</hi> reuolted to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> for dred of their great puiſſance of footemen. But after that the fléete was abroade, it is to be thought that many moe ſituate by the ſea coaſtes, yelded themſelues for fear to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes.</hi> Thus Fortune fauoured eyther part equally, but <hi>Italy</hi> was oft times ſore moleſted with the incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Libian</hi> Nauie. But <hi>Africa</hi> was nothing troubled with any army or hoſte of their enimies: which thing being diligently po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered, the <hi>Romanes</hi> determined to coape with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſea. Which thyng eſpecially ſolicitated &amp; prouoked me to ſpeake of this warre at large, leaſt any ſhould be ignoraunt of this principle, how &amp; at what time, and for what cauſes the <hi>Romanes</hi> were

enforced to prepare a Nauy to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their aduerſaries. When the <hi>Romanes</hi> perceiued that the war could not otherwiſe be finiſhed, they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Nauy of an hundreth &amp; twenty ſhippes, of the which a hundreth were Quinqueremes, and the reſidue Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remes. In the preparance of this nauy the Quinqueremes were very combe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; hard to be built, bicauſe no ſuch Barkes were vſed in <hi>Italy</hi> before that time, for which cauſe the excellency &amp; magnanimitie of the <hi>Romanes</hi> is to be maruelled at, being men altogether ignorant of the ſeas, which before that time hadde neuer regarded the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therof, nowe ſo couragiouſly to venter vpon them, as though they had already va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed their enimies, with whom they neuer tryed that kinde of combat. Alſo conſidering how at that preſent the <hi>Africans</hi> by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all men, were moſt expert &amp; actiue vpon the waters, as a thing left vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their forefathers for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is both a ſinguler teſtimo

ny &amp; a good argument of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acts which I intend to treate of, &amp; the hautineſſe of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> For at their firſte ſayling to <hi>Meſſana,</hi> they had not only no ſhips of war, but ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any little Barke or veſſell, but boro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing ſhips of the <hi>Tarentines, Locrines,</hi> and <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> for the ſafetie of their army. There rode at that preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes</hi> ſhips about the coaſtes of <hi>Scicily,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence one of the quinqueremes houering aloofe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fléet, being wracked, by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Romans,</hi> at which thei toke exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to make theirs: whilſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nauy was in furniſhing, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army was trained in learning to row after this maner. Ther wer ſeats made orderly in the ſande, in which the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſat, &amp; were warned by the voice of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral which ſtode in the midſt of them, to ſtretch forth their armes altogither, and likewiſe to drawe them in by the ſande, ſo that at a certaine ſigne, they all began and lefte of togither. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to this rate they lerned to rowe,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:35"/>
then the ſhippes being finiſhed, they entred the ſea, &amp; within a fewe dayes after made a true trial in the waters. <hi>Gaius Cornelius</hi> the Conſul, which not long before was made generall of the Nauy, hauing brought all the ſhippes into the déepe, paſſed the ſeas to <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> with ſeuentene ſayle, leauing the reſidue about the coaſtes of <hi>Italy.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had prepared all things neceſſary to his Fleete at <hi>Meſſana,</hi> ſpying a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, he paſſed wyth the ſame ſhippes to the Ilands <hi>Hyparides.</hi> About that time <hi>Hanniball</hi> the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> capitaine was ariued at <hi>Pauormus.</hi> He hearing tell of the Conſuls arriuall, ſent one <hi>Boodius</hi> a Senatour of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> thither with twenty ſhips, which comming vpon them ſodainly in the night, finding the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſhips in the Hauen, enuironed them. The Conſull thus being preuented at vnawares, wiſt not what way was the beſt to take, but in the ende yelded himſelfe as ouercome to his enimies, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15198:35"/>
conueyed him &amp; the priſes to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Within a few days after this ouerthrowe of <hi>Cornelius, Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom fortune as yet through hir benignitie had ſmiled, not oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him with any ſiniſter chance, hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring tell that the <hi>Romane</hi> Nauie rode in the coaſtes of <hi>Italy,</hi> not farre diſtant from <hi>Scicily,</hi> earneſtly deſired to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the multitude, order, and buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his ennimies Nauie: for the which purpoſe he elected fiftie ſhippes, and paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> but in ſtede of the <hi>Italian</hi> coaſtes (Fortune now turning hir tippet) he was driuen amongeſt the fléete of his enimies, which being well prepared and ready at all points, aſſailed him immediatly, ſo that looſing the moſt part of his ſhippes, he eſcaped away very hardly, yet better than he did hope for. After this the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſetting towarde <hi>Scicilie,</hi> were aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the captiues, of the miſfortune chaunced to the Conſul, wherfore they ſent a poſte to <hi>Caius Duellius</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb facs="tcp:15198:36"/>
and capitaine of the footemen. But whilſt thei houered for him, word came that the power of their enimies was at hand, therfore they dreſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues towards the naual conflict. But conſidering how their ſhips were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlowe and nothing apt to celeritie, they inuented certain munitions and defences for euery one of them, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called Crowes. The munition was founde in this ſorte. There was a piller of wood erected in the ſterne of the ſhip, four elles in length and thrée hands in bredth, hauing in the toppe a pulley with ſtayres made of planckes adioyning to it, which were four foote in breadth and ſix elles in length, the ſtayres were made hollowe, hauing munitions in faſhion of battlements vp to the toppe of the cannes and knée plates, in the ende of the piller was a ſharpe inſtrument of iron tyed to the ſtayres wyth a rope in a ryng, and it was in faſhion much like to a mattock ſo that this engine reſembled much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15198:36"/>
thoſe with the which corne is hoyſted out of ſhippes, with the which inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſone as they ioyned with their enimies, ſlacking the rope and letting it downe, it faſtned inſolubly in theyr aduer aries Barke by the heauineſſe of the weight, ſo that if the forepartes met, two men deſcended together by the ſtaires, the two formoſte always bearing targets, with which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the reſt. If they met croſſpath or ouerthwartes, they eaſily ſkipped out at all parts. After this preparance to the Nauall warre, <hi>Caius Duellius</hi> hauing knowledge of the infortunate chaunce, happened to hys compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on captaine of the nauie, left his hoſte with the Tribunes, haſting hym ſelfe towardes the fleete: and hearing ſaye, that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie farre from <hi>Mylis,</hi> with great ſpéede made thyther wyth hys whole power. The <hi>Africanes</hi> as ſoone as they heard tell of theyr enimies comming, were in hope to haue good ſucceſſe (ſuppoſing
<pb facs="tcp:15198:37"/>
the <hi>Romanes</hi> to be vnſkilfull in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Nauie) wherefore they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thirty ſhips, putting them forth to maete their enimies without al feare, as though they had gone forth to fetch home ſome wonne booty: their captain was <hi>Hanniball,</hi> which (as I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed a litle before) conducted his army out of <hi>Agrigentine</hi> in the night time through his enimies campe. He had a Septireme, which in time paſt belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>Pirrhus</hi> king of <hi>Epirotes.</hi> Nowe when the Nauies were within pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect one of the other, and that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were eſpied in euery ſhip ſterne, the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> were ſore diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the aſpect of ſuch a rare ſight, but at the length reiecting all fearfull and daſtardly cowardneſſe, little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the newe inuented engines, ſet vpon their enimies with a bolde cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The ſhippes being grapled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, the <hi>Romanes</hi> aſſayled their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, deſcending out of their owne ſhippes into theirs, by their newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented

engins. Many of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> were ſlayne, the reſt amazed at the pollicy of their aduerſaries, yelded to them. This conflict reſembled much the conflicts and ſkirmiſhes made on the lande and not much vnlike in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus were the thirty ſhippes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which aſſayled the <hi>Romanes</hi> wyth the Pretors, which as I ſhewed before be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>longed to king <hi>Pirrhus.

The reſidue of the <hi>Carthagenean</hi> Nauye entred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly vpon their enimies, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing how the former company wer entrapped with their enimies engins, began to practiſe their fraudulent fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; deceitful wiles, not entring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the accuſtomed guyſe, but ouerthwartly vſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> celerity of their ſhippes, ſuppoſing therby to eſcape the daunger. But the inuentions were ſo aptly diſpoſed and placed, that they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb facs="tcp:15198:38"/>
claſped them which waye ſo euer they entred, with which ſtrange ſight the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> beyng amazed, toke their flight, hauing loſt fiftie ſhips in that conflict. The <hi>Romanes</hi> hauing thus obtained the domination of the ſeas, perſiſted in their warres, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier employed their buſines, ſailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coaſtes of <hi>Segeſtana,</hi> deliuering the towne there from beſieging, then ſetting from them, they wonne the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Macella.</hi> After theſe warres on the ſea, <hi>Amilcar</hi> captaine ouer the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginean</hi> army, which then lay in <hi>Scicilie,</hi> hearing tell how there was a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſprong betwixt the <hi>Romane</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the aydes (ſent from their confederates) contending of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe and worthie acts, inſomuch that the forainers their adiutours, beyng vanquiſhed, were incamped by them ſelues.

            <p>

After theſe factes thus finiſhed, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> with the remnant whiche were eſcaped from the conflict, came to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> from whence ſoone after accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with certaine noble captaines &amp; a nauie of triremes, he was ſente in to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where within a fewe days after, being incloſed in a certaine por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terangle, by the <hi>Romanes</hi> loſt the moſt part of his ſhippes, him ſelfe eſcapyng the hands of his enimies: but ſhortly after being taken of the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> he was hanged for his euill doings on the gallows.

               <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> lay there. At their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual immediatly they embatailed their men before the citie, but the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> being within the walles offered not once to come forth, which thing the <hi>Romanes</hi> perceyuing, departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to <hi>Hippana,</hi> which they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly toke. They likewiſe toke <hi>Miſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi> which by reaſon of impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe had reſiſted a certaine time. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they brought their army againſt the <hi>Camerenenſes,</hi> which a little before had rebelled againſt them, which with terrible continuance, warlike wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and tearing torments they van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. <hi>Atna</hi> &amp; diuers other townes were taken by them.

About this time <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Tutelius</hi> the Conſull and captaine of the Nauie lay in the coaſtes of the <hi>Tinderitans,</hi> where he eſpied the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginean</hi> Nauie ſayling by the coaſte, wherfore he commaunded his men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently to make them ready in al haſt, and follow him. Then he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15198:39"/>
with ten ſhippes, marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde before the reſt. The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> eſpying this tricke, how part of their enimies were but entring into their ſhippes, another ſort launching into the déepe, and the firſt company farre diſtant from all the reſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſodainly with an incredible ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie drowning many of the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſhippes, and the Pretors ſhippe with thoſe that were in hir, ſcantly eſcaped with great rowing and much labour.

In the beginning of the next ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:15198:40"/>
hauyng furniſhed them ſelues of all neceſſaries, they repaired to the warre againe.

The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> paſſed the ſea with thrée hundreth and fiftie ſhippes, remaining at <hi>Lilybeum.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> conſulted concernyng a voyage into <hi>Africa,</hi> iudging it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſayle thither with their whole puiſſance, to the ende that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes</hi> ſhoulde not only be diſquieted in <hi>Scicily,</hi> but alſo moleſted at home in their natiue countreye. On the other part the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> perceuing how eaſie a thyng it was to deſcende into <hi>Lybia,</hi> alſo howe faynte hearted the people were, the ennimie beyng once entred into the Prouince, therefore they intended incontinentely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> hopyng by

that meanes to ſtoppe their exploite into <hi>Africa.</hi> In this manner the one parte preparing to inuade, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſiſte, foreſhewed the greate warres to enſue. The <hi>Romans</hi> hauing prepared all things neceſſarie to their Nauie, elected out of their number of footmen, ſuche as were of moſt hautie and valyant corage, imbarkyng them then they made a quadripartite diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Nauie, gyuyng to euery parte a double name, ſauyng to the laſt, which ſtill reteyned the name of the rearewarde, as is accuſtomed in other battailes. There was aboue a hundreth and fortie thouſande men in the <hi>Romane</hi> nauie, euery ſhip had thrée hundreth rowers, and ſixe ſcore figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> hauyng prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theyr Nauie of ſhyppes, béeyng fraughted onely with men, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the leaſt to the numbre of a hundreth and fiftie thouſand: ſo that not onely the beholders, but alſo they
<pb facs="tcp:15198:41"/>
which heard tell of the huge number, great abilitie, and worthy acts of theſe two armies, may wonder. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> perceyuing that this their naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of neceſſitie muſt be ouertwhart and crooked, alſo calling to minde the expertnes of their enimies in rowing, purpoſed to make their courſe inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, placing the two Sepremes in which <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> &amp; <hi>Lucius Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forefront with an equal diſtance, after theſe the firſt &amp; ſeconde warde followed, kéeping like compaſſe which betwixt euery two was enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with their ſtemmes ſticking out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. The Nauy being protract on a length, fronting on the former ſhips, had a triangle on each ſyde, vnto the which was ioyned the thirde Nauy, in the maner of a proppe or piller, ſo that the three frontes being diſpoſed thus, they reſembled a perfect triangle. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third Nauy came the carts and foiſts, in which their horſes were tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, &amp; there was cordes which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15198:41"/>
out of them into the third nauie: after theſe came y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reareward in their order, which were diſpoſed that they ſurmounted and exceded the wing of them which marched before. The <hi>Romane</hi> fléete being ſette in order af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner, the firſt partes which were the two triangles of the ſides, were voyd in the midſt, the other that folowed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, they which came after the piller or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, were more ſolide, ſo that the whole nauie was ſure and indiſſoluble. By this time the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> Captaines had gathered their ſtrength and exhorted their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that they ſhould be of bolde and ſtoute corage, informing them if they conquered the <hi>Romans</hi> in this combat, afterward they ſhould fight for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and ſoueraigntie of <hi>Scicilye:</hi> but if the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhold ſuppreſſe them they ſhould not warre for <hi>Scicilie,</hi> but for their countrey, for theyr fréedome and for their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hauing thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
<pb facs="tcp:15198:42"/>
their ſouldiers, they commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to goe a boorde. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently obeyed the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theyr generall, ſhewing them ſelues very forwarde, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the eminent danger. Now when the gouernours of the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> army had perceiued the order of the <hi>Roman</hi> fléete, they likewiſe diuided their Army into foure partes, of the which thrée be launched into the déepe, &amp; lay with their right wing extended out in length with the foure partes of their ſhippes bent towardes their enimies, as though they would haue inuironed them. The fourth parte which was the left wing, remayned as vnder a munition by the ſhore. <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Amilcar</hi> were generalls of the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> nauie. <hi>Hanno</hi> ruled ouer the right wing, hauing with him the ſwifter ſhippes, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> the left, with the ſlugs. This was he which (as is before declared)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15198:42"/>
eſcaped ſo hardly at <hi>Tindarides.</hi> Now <hi>Amilcar</hi> vſed this pollicie. The Conſuls at their firſte méeting, eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forefront of the <hi>Africans</hi> to be very thinne, bruſt in through the middeſt of them with great violence, which according as <hi>Amilcar</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, fained a recoyle, to the ende that they might ſeuer and diſioyne the <hi>Roman</hi> nauie, which purſued them now earneſtle, ſo that the firſte and ſecond warde marching after theyr enimies, and the thyrd and fourth comming ſlowly after, cauſed that the two firſt wards were ſeperated from the laſt. Which ſeperation being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> there was a ſigne made out of <hi>Amilcars</hi> ſhippe, as they were agréed before, at which ſight with a ſodayne inuerſion they returned, inuading the <hi>Romans</hi> which purſued them. The battayle was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible and cruell. The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> farre exceded the <hi>Romans,</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb facs="tcp:15198:43"/>
fleights and ſwift rowing: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it came to handblowes, &amp; the ſhippes were grapled, the <hi>Romans</hi> paſſed in ſtrength &amp; worthineſſe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I haue declared, was the beginning of the nauall warres. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> which (as I declared before) was captaine of the right wing, eſpying the battaile to be begonne with the forewarde of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſet forwarde to inuade the rearewarde, where was a terrible &amp; perillous conflict, during long &amp; very douteful. Then the fourth warde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> ſet towards their enimies &amp; incountred with that fléete which had the ferry botes, who letting the ropes ſlippe, aſſailed them very fiercely. Thus was the battaile deuided into thrée partes, &amp; there was thrée nauall conflictes at one tyme, euery one farre ſeperate from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the which the fightes were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, bicauſe of their equalitie, eche parte encountred other couragiouſly,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15198:43"/>
all things went alyke on bothe ſides. Then in continuaunce, <hi>Amilcar</hi> with his company were put to flight, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Manlius</hi> perſiſted in purſuing hys enimies, but <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> eſpying the conflictes in the rearewarde, and amongſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hulkes, haſted him to aide them with the ſecond ward: the reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde which had ben in great perill &amp; daunger, and almoſt ſuppreſt by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> were ſo incoraged and animated by the Conſuls comming, that they fought couragiouſly.

which laye as though they had ben be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged &amp; almoſt ouercome, which had cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in déede, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> being afraid of theyr crowes, durſt not graple with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudyed to driue them to the ſhore.

Thus theſe thrée battayles were foughte ſeuerally betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> on one day, according to thys preſcript order, in which the <hi>Romans</hi> were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, of whoſe Nauie there was foure and twenty Shippes wracked, of the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> aboue thyrtie. The <hi>Romans</hi> had no fraughted ſhippes taken, but they tooke to the number of thrée ſcore and moe. After this combate hauing repaired theyr taken ſhippes, and ioyned them to theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, hauing victualles and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15198:44"/>
collected, departed towardes <hi>Libia.</hi> There is a place in <hi>Africa</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Promentary</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea towards <hi>Scicilye,</hi> ther the <hi>Romans</hi> arriued firſt, from whence hauing repayred theyr ſhippes, they ſayled to <hi>Clypia,</hi> and there not farre from the Citie hauing diſbarqued the ſouldiers, begonne to enuironne the Towne with dytches and trenches. They had prepared all things redie to beſiege the Towne, but the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants yelded them ſelues willingly to them. Now the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> which had before fled from the nauall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, were arriued at <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Roman</hi> army after theyr proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſſe, to haue gone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thyther, for which ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they leuied a great number of horſemen, footemen, and ſhippes to defende the neceſſarie places of the Citie. After all this preparaunce being finiſhed, it is to vnderſtanded
<pb facs="tcp:15198:45"/>
how the Conſuls had beſieged the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Clipia,</hi> reiecting all domeſticall feare, they prepared men redy to their warre both by water and lande, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting nothing belonging to the ſafetie of the prouince or citie. In the meane time the Conſuls hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Citie of <hi>Clipie,</hi> and put ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into it, they ſent legats to <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſhould certifie the Senate of their affairs, &amp; bring them word what they ſhould then take in hand. Finally they brought their whole army to the Frontiers of <hi>Carthage,</hi> inuading the prouince without interruption, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, forraging, and waſting the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before them, burning &amp; deſtroying the ſumptuous buildings, ſeaſing all kinde of praies and booties bringing aboue twentie thouſande laborers to their ſhippes. In the meane time the legates ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> were returned, making relation how the ſenate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one of the Conſuls to remaine in <hi>Africa,</hi> with the hoaſt, and the other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15198:45"/>
to repaire to <hi>Rome</hi> with the nauie.</p>
            <p>The Conſuls perceiuing the mindes of the Senate, agréed that <hi>Marcus At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius Regulus</hi> ſhold remaine in <hi>Africa,</hi> with fortie ſhippes, fiftene thouſande footemen and fiue hundreth horſemen, and that <hi>Manlius</hi> with the reſidue of the nauie and hoaſt, with all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of captiues ſhould retorne to <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> perceiuing by the great preparation of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that this warre ſhold be of long continuance, appointed <hi>Aſdruball</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hanno</hi> &amp; <hi>Boſtarus,</hi> captaines of their hoſt. Then they ſent to <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> to <hi>Heraclea,</hi> which immediatly came to <hi>Carthage,</hi> with fiue thouſande footemen and fiue hundreth horſemen, &amp; was aſſociate the thirde captaine to them. The thrée generals beganne to conſulte amongſt them ſelues concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the adminiſtration of the warrs, in which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation they determined to ayde the prouince, and not to ſuffre ſuch hauocke and waſte to be made of
<pb facs="tcp:15198:46"/>
the Region. Then <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> within a few dayes after, went to the Citie <hi>Adis,</hi> indeuoring him ſelfe to beſiege and conquere it, of which the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> hauing knowledge, employed their whole diligence to receiue and deliuer it from the ſiege, marching forwarde wyth their whole Army towardes the <hi>Romans,</hi> to ſuch tyme as they came to a hyll, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the right wing of theyr eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, on the which for certayne conſiderations they pighte theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilions, ſuppoſing it to bée a place moſt expedient and apte for theyr purpoſe. All theyr truſte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of victorie, were in theyr Horſemen and Elephantes. Thus forſaking the playnes and valeys, they aſcended with theyr Armye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a highe, huge and ſtéepe platte, euen as it were teaching theyr eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies what they ſhould doe, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doute it chaunced after: for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15198:46"/>
               <hi>Romans</hi> perceiuing how the Elepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (in the which theyr enimies putte theyr chiefe confidence) were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprofitable for battayle, and of no force in the mountaines, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be beſt, not to deferre or prolong the tyme any longer, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to permit them to deſcende in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the plaines, but incontinently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting no oportunitie, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the hyll on eyther ſide, by which deuiſe it came to paſſe that the power of the Elephantes and Horſemen, were of no force and to no purpoſe, ſo that onely the mercynarie ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fought out of the higher places, conſtrayning the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiers a lyttle to retyre, but the other part of the hyll was ſodainely vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the <hi>Romans</hi> aſcended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> perceiuing them ſelues to be inuironed on euery ſide with theyr enimies, immediatly they fledde and left theyr tentes ſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:47"/>
flying downe by the ſhoote banke. The <hi>Romans</hi> a certaine ſpace purſued the footemen, then hauing ſpoyled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tents &amp; making diuerſe recourſes through the whole prouince, ſpoyled the fields and rifled the Townes. Shortly after they inuaded and toke <hi>Tunis,</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that it was a very fit place for the warres, lying againſt <hi>Carthage</hi> &amp; the prouince incamped there. The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> being a lyttle before ouercome by ſea, were now likewiſe ſuppreſſed by land of the <hi>Romans</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers battailes, not for lacke of men or ſtrength, but of pollicie &amp; experte cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Thus they were diſquieted with diuerſe afflictions, and in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theyr health. After this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate wherein they were ſo diſperſed &amp; foyled, there aroſe a great route of the <hi>Numidians</hi> againſt them, hoping to get ſome gaines, of whome they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much hurt as of the <hi>Romans,</hi> for they being a gredy couetous pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſnatching and rauenous nation,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15198:47"/>
depopulated and waſted all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> quaking for feare of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> fledde out of the prouince into the citie, where as they were greatly diſcoraged, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticating the furyous famine lyke to enſue, as well for the multitude of people incloſed within the Citie, as for feare of the long ſiege. Now <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> perfectely vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great daunger that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes</hi> were in both by ſea and by land, ſo that the citie within a ſmall tracte of time, wold reuolte and yelde vnto him, yet fearing leaſt the new Conſul then redy to come into <hi>Africa,</hi> ſhold aſcribe the facinorous &amp; worthy actes done by him, to his owne glory &amp; praiſe, thought it beſt to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude peace with the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> which grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and with ioyful mindes accepted it, diſmiſſing the chiefe men of theyr citie to intreate with the Conſul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the concluſion of the league. This matter being thus brought to
<pb facs="tcp:15198:48"/>
paſſe, yet were the demaundes ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that they refuſed to take truce with them, yea they were ſo farre out of meaſure, that they could not ſuffer the Conſul to ſpeake to them, for <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> hauing the victory and dominion ouer all things, thought whatſoeuer hée offered to the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte it as a gifte or rewarde: but they on the contrary parte, thought there could be nothing more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſharpe, cruell, or byting, than the wordes of the Conſul were vnto them, being driuen to the laſt pinch. Wherefore they departed, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enimies and peace vnconcluded, but alſo abhorring and deteſting the aunſwere of <hi>Attilius,</hi> as too greuous, diſpleaſant, paynefull, and harde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as to magnificke, ſtately, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogante.</p>
            <p>When they hadde ſhewed theſe things in the ſenate houſe at <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:15198:48"/>
though long before they were in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, and hadde no hope of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſe, neuertheleſſe, yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vnreaſonable requeſtes of the Conſul, with a great diſdayne they did animate them ſelues, reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theyr priſtinate corages, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining rather to abide extreme daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and calamities, yea and death it ſelfe, than to ſuffre any reproche, infamie, or diſworſhippe, eyther of their good name, or of the worthie and famous actes done and atchieued by them. At that ſame preſent a certaine <hi>Carthaginean,</hi> (by chaunce) which was ſent into <hi>Grecia</hi> at the beginning to hyer ſouldiours, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home with a greate troupe and multitude of men, amongſt whome there was one <hi>Zantippus,</hi> a <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi> who was a paſſing expert and cunning Souldier, &amp; had ben much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed &amp; trained in the warres, which hearing tell of the conflict and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb facs="tcp:15198:49"/>
of the <hi>Carthaginenſes:</hi> alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing how it was fought and being enformed of the time and place wher, further conſidering their preparance with horſe and Elephants, turned him to his companions, &amp; ſayde: The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes</hi> toke not this ouerthrow of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but through their euill guiding and ignorance of their vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert captaines. Theſe wordes of <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus</hi> immediatly were bruted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the whole citie, and came to the eares of the rulers, which made him to be called before them, minding to trie his counſayle. Now when <hi>Zantippus</hi> was come to them, &amp; had ſhewed the reaſon of his wordes and the cauſes why the <hi>Romans</hi> made ſuch hauocke of their men, he promiſed if they would be counſailed by him (afterwards lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the hills and high places keping the plaines) that he would inſtructe them how to ſaue them ſelues, and a redy way to ouercome their enimies. The <hi>Carthaginean</hi> Captaines being
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15198:49"/>
moued with theſe words of <hi>Zantippus</hi> incontinently auctorized him generall ouer the whole armie: and there was a great rumour noiſed abrode through the whole hoſt, of <hi>Zantippus</hi> wordes, ſo that there was nothing but pleſant noyſe and merye talke thorough the whole armie. When he had broughte the ſouldiers out of the citie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailed them, there appeared ſuche manifeſte difference betwixte them, and the other vntrayned Captaines, that all the people cried oute wyth a clamorous ſhout, they deſired nothing ſo much as warre, they had ſuch a good hope <hi>Zantippus</hi> being their guider.</p>
            <p>Theſe things beyng thus broughte to paſſe, the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> Captaines per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ardent zeale &amp; feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the ſouldiers, exhorted them as the tyme permitted: then wythin a fewe dayes after, brought them forth againſt their enimies. There was in the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> armie aboue twelue thouſande footemen, foure thouſande
<pb facs="tcp:15198:50"/>
horſemen, and nygh a hundreth Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. <hi>Marcus Attllius</hi> hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his enimies, though he were ſomewhat aſtonnyed to ſee them (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their accuſtomed rate) keepe in the plaines, and place their tents in them, yet being very deſirous of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, hée marched forwarde to méete them, placing his tentes within two hundreth paces of his ennimies. The next day folowyng the <hi>African</hi> Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains tooke counſell amongeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues what was beſt to be done. The whole multitude turned to <hi>Zantippus,</hi> callyng hym by name, and ſayde that they were redie, and prepared to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them ſelues what daunger ſoeuer there were, deſiring him to make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the battaile. The <hi>Carthagine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> captaines perceyuyng the valiaunt courage of their ſouldiers and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they had to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering alſo the preſence of <hi>Zantippus,</hi> thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was a moſte conuenient time to ſet vpon their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15198:50"/>
wherfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to prepare them ſelues, they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Zantippus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regiment of the army to rule at his pleaſure. He hauyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the captains, authoritie ouer the hoſt, ſet towards his aduerſaries, &amp; in araying his armie, placed the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants euery one in his order, before the forefront of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile: a litle ſpace after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he placed a legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes,</hi> appointing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtipendarie ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to kepe the right and left corner then he appointed them of moſte agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to fight betwixte the two wings of the horſſmen. The <hi>Romanes</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng their ennimies in a readyneſſe, prepared and made readye theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſettyng the moſte valyaunt and actiue Souldiours that coulde bée pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked oute of the whole companie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the Elephantes. After them, they fortified theyr forefront with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſundry munitions, pointing their horſmen in either wing, placing their ſtanderds not in the beginning,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:51"/>
but in the ſtrength of the battail their order was very ſlender in the breaſt, and ſtrengthned with many aydes in the backe to withſtand the force of the elephants. But as it was wel proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to kéepe backe the beaſts, ſo it was very daungerous for being ingired, for the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> hauing the greater troupe of horſſes, might eaſilier enuiron the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſpoſed ſo ſtraightly. Now both the companions beyng preſt to ioyne battaile, either of them looked to be aſſailed of other. As ſone as <hi>Zantippus</hi> had commanded the elephantes to be put towarde the enimies, the horſemen of both wings braſte in egerly. The <hi>Romanes</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of their countrey, ſounding their trumpets, commanded their ſouldiers to girde valiantly into the thickeſt of the armie. The ſyghte was very ſharp and terrible amongſt them: but the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiers drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the multitude of the <hi>Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> fled incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly from both wings,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15198:51"/>
the footemen of the left wing hauyng inclined the force of the elephantes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed nothyng the multitude of the hired ſouldiers, but ruſhed in valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the right wing of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes,</hi> putting them to flight, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng them ſharply to their tents: but thoſe whiche were placed next to the Elephants were hurled down &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne on heapes by the filthy bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. The fortune of victorie depended doubtful, the reſiſtants defended them ſelues ſo worthily: but after the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of the <hi>Romanes</hi> was compaſſed in with the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> horſemen, &amp; wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to encounter with them, &amp; thoſe, which (as I ſhewed) were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midſt to reſiſt the elepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, driuen on the ſtrongeſt companie of their ennimies, by whome they were ſuppreſſed and quite ouerthrowne, the <hi>Romanes</hi> began to languiſhe and faynt on euery part, ſome being trode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down with the multitude of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cruell &amp; fierce beaſtes, other ſlaine by the horſſemen
<pb facs="tcp:15198:52"/>
in the ſame place where they ſtode in the beginning, ſo that a ſmall handful remained to the latter end, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing there was no hope of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, fled away to ſaue them ſelues, but they alſo the place being very plaine, were ouerrunne with horſemen and elephants, other fiue hundreth flying away with <hi>Marcus Attilius,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped and taken by their enimies.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> armie were ſlayn eight hundreth hired ſouldiers, which fought in the left wing againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</hi> Of the other parte eſcaped on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two thouſande with their enſignes and ſtanderdes, which (as you heard a litle before) chaſed the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> to their tents, all the reſt ſauing <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Attilius,</hi> and a few which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him, wer ſlaine.

There is alſo an other cauſe alleaged for his departure, as I ſhal ſhew more at large in his place. When relation was made at <hi>Rome,</hi> of the ouerthrowe of their hoſt, and the Conſuls taking, alſo howe the reſt of their armie were beſieged in <hi>Clipia,</hi> they prepared to ayde them, leuying a populous armie whiche they ſent into <hi>Africa.</hi> In thys meane tyme, the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Clipia,</hi> labouryng earneſtly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer com it, hoping to take thoſe which eſcaped the battaile.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15198:54"/>
that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vaine, who perceiuing their trauayle to bée of none effecte, rayſed their campe.

ſeaſing a hundreth &amp; fourtene fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted priſes, thence ſaylyng to <hi>Clipea,</hi> they receiued the <hi>Romane</hi> Souldiers, and remained a while in <hi>Africa,</hi> and then returned to <hi>Scicilie.</hi> When they had proſperouſly paſſed ouer the ſea, betwixt <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Scicilie,</hi> and were not farre diſtant from the citie <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> there chaunced ſuch a great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and ſhypwracke to them, as can not be well expreſſed: for of ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fortie and foure ſhippes, ſcante foure ſcore were ſaued, all the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either drenched or rent with roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, goared vp the ſhore with carka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and other trafike.

and the can i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſignes, but they reiected and dyd ſette light the Counſell of the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and puffed vp in pride with their former victories, alſo beyng deſirous of a fewe holdes of litle value, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to their enimies, ſo that their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and triumphant victorie, whiche they had obtained before, was blemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed wyth this myſerable calamitie, ſuffering ſeuere puniſhment for their vnbridled boldeneſſe, and as they are in dede valiant, ſo they ſuppoſe that al ſuch exploites as they purpoſe to take in hand, muſt of neceſſitie be finiſhed, iudging nothyng impoſſible for them: &amp; as diuers times in this their vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed raſheneſſe they had fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſo many times they erre &amp; ſlyde into great and manifeſt dangers, and eſpecially in combates on the ſea, for though in conflictes on the lande, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching onely with men, they often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes haue the preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, yet on the ſeas, they ſo hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brainely haſard them ſelues, that ofte

tymes they are peſtred with great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles as they are at this preſent, and ſundry other times, and ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, except they repreſſe and bridle their vntamed raſheneſſe. When the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> had knowledge of thys vnluckie chaunce happened to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> they earneſtly employed their whole diligence to the Nauall warre on the ſea, ſuppoſyng them ſelues no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to the <hi>Romanes</hi> by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for this their infortunate chance, and equall with them by land, bicauſe they had ouercome the hoſt of <hi>Marcus Attilius.</hi> Wherfore immediately they ſent <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> with all their olde ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with a Nauie of two hundreth ſhippes, parte newe made, parte ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their ſtemmes and tackeling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed: alſo a hundreth and fortie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephantes, with a ſupplement of new Souldiers into <hi>Scicilie,</hi> whiche hauing his armie ſafely conducted to <hi>Lilybeum</hi> daily exerciſed his Souldiers and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes, continually moleſting the

friendes of the <hi>Romanes</hi> thoroughout all <hi>Scicilie.</hi> Althoughe the calamitie of the great ſhipwracke had diſcouraged and appalled the heartes of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> yet they diſdained to giue place to the <hi>Carthaginenſes.</hi> Wherefore they prepared a new nauie of two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndreth and twentie ſhyppes, which was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſuche celeritie, that within thrée monethes they were vndockte, and ſette on the water, which may be thoughte a thing almoſte incredible. <hi>Aulus Aquilius</hi> and <hi>Caius Cornelius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſuls, were appointed to ſayle into <hi>Scicilie</hi> with that Nauie, and to make warre with the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> whiche incontinentely takyng theyr iourney, came to <hi>Meſſana,</hi> where as they did receiue the remnaunt of the Shippewracke; whiche made in the whole, a nauie of thrée hundreth ſaile.

both ſides, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> within few days with their torments, brakes &amp; ſlings, they battered downe the Toure, entryng in with greate violence, and woon the baſe towne called <hi>Neapolis,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once taken, the Citizens ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, yelded the other partes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the olde towne. When <hi>Panormus</hi> was taken, the Conſuls left certain ſouldiers there, and returned to <hi>Rome.</hi> The next <hi>Caius Seruilius,</hi> and <hi>Cneius Sempronius,</hi> beyng choſen in their places, toke the nauie, and paſſed the ſeas into <hi>Scicilie,</hi> from thence into <hi>Africa,</hi> where ariuing in the prouince, they ſet their armie on land in diuers places, making greate hauocke euery where, yet they dyd nothyng worthie writing: At length they ariued in the Iſle of the <hi>Lotophagians,</hi> called <hi>Mirmix</hi> not farre diſtant from the little <hi>Syrtes</hi> or quickeſandes, where not knowing the places through which they ſhoulde ſayle, chaunced in a ſtraighte angle, where their ſhippes were grounded

by the ebbing of the ſea, during which time they ſtoode in a maruellous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie &amp; almoſt drownde in diſpaire, vntyll the water by flowing, ſet them on foote againe, yet could their not ſcape ſcotfrée, but of conſtraint were compelled to emptie their ſhips, and caſt their balleſſe ouer borde. After that daye the <hi>Romans</hi> being pinched with ſo many perills, made their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages by ſea, as though the enimies had ben in their tailes. After this they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>Scicilye,</hi> vanquiſhed <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybium,</hi> &amp; remained at <hi>Panormus,</hi> front whence as they paſſed towards <hi>Italye,</hi> there aroſe ſuch a ſodayn tempeſt that aboue a hundreth and fiftie ſhippes of their nauie were diſperſed by the rage of the Seas, which after long toſſing from poſt to piller, were wracked and loſt. The <hi>Romans</hi> being daunted with theſe hurtes and calamities, though they eſtemed the maieſtie &amp; honour of their Empire aboue all other things, yet being oppreſſed with theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:58"/>
determined vtterly to forſake the ſeas. Then they only prepared an Army on the lande, which were ſent into <hi>Scicilye,</hi> vnder the tuition of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Cacilius</hi> and <hi>Caius Curius</hi> being Conſuls, to whome they deliuered onely thrée ſcore ſhippes, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of their corne and victualls, by which it came to paſſe, that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> hadde the ſuperioritie againe, for the <hi>Roman</hi> nauie taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they only ruled ouer the waters hauing alſo great confidence in their army and Elephantes on the land. The <hi>Romans,</hi> being aduertiſed of the battaile fought in <hi>Africa,</hi> and the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing backe of their armye onely tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the multitude and ſtrength of the Elephants which brake their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile and diſturbed their orders, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great confuſion in the hoſt, after that time they were ſo pauled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of the beaſtes, that for the ſpace of two yeares next enſuing, when they ſhould haue coped with their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

either in <hi>Africa</hi> or in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they neuer durſt encounter with them, or pitche theyr Tentes in the valeyes, but continually kept in the hilles and high places, for no other cauſe but onely to ſhielde them ſelues from the Elephantes. The <hi>Romans</hi> perceiuing their hoſte to be thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraged, without lingering prepared a new Nauie, and hauing an electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of officers, <hi>Caius Attilius</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Manlius</hi> were appointed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls. Thus furniſhing fiftie newe ſhippes, and repayring the olde Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, they leuied a freſhe Armye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſdruball</hi> Captaine of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes,</hi> perceiuing the fearfulneſſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> alſo hauing knowledge by the fugitiues of the <hi>Romans</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp; alſo hearing how one of the Conſuls was determined to repaire into <hi>Italye,</hi> with part of the Armye, &amp; that only <hi>Metellus</hi> with ſcant half of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army ſhold remaine at <hi>Panormus,</hi> now <hi>Autumne</hi> drawing nye, he remoued

from <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> and brought his armie to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> territories of <hi>Panormus. <hi>Metellus</hi>
               </hi> perceiuing his enimies to be at hand, &amp; ſeing <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> deſirous of battaile, reſtrained his men within the walles, which thing much more incenſed the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> captaine, in ſo much, that hauing ſpoiled and burned the fieldes on euery ſide, he marched toward <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normus.</hi> The Conſul kept his men ſo long within, that he miniſtred the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies occaſion to paſſe the riuer which fronted on the walles. The Conſul perceiuing the Elephants and mayne army to approche, he ſent out his moſt actiue ſouldiers to ſolicitate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his aduerſaries that they might come to the hands of the reſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that all things chanced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his minde, he appointed ſuch as were of moſt agilitie to ſtande as it were a rampier aboue a ditch, from whence they ſhould fight with their enimies a farre of with their dartes, and other rouing weapons, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15198:59"/>
them that if at any tyme the beaſtes began to rage, they ſhold ſkip into the ditches, and from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hurle at them againe: he made a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of dartes or pykes to be conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Citie, which he placed in the pits. Then he with all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtandarts ſtoode at a nother co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary angle of the Citie butting on the left wing of hys enimies. As ſoone as the battaile was begon, the maiſter of the Elephants being very deſirous of honour and the name of a conquerour, nothing eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Aſdrubals</hi> commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the beaſtes againſte the light ſouldiers, which according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls commaundement gaue back, and ſeing the beaſts purſue them very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely, ſkipped into the ditches. Now when the Elepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were come to the pitte ſide, they were ſo galled, what with ſhaftes ſhot out of the Towne, &amp; the ſouldiers pikes in the trenches, that they could paſſe no further, but were compelled to recoyle and burſt
<pb facs="tcp:15198:60"/>
in among their owne Armie, pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their order, and making great ſlaughter amongſt them. While this broyle was in hande, in came <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> with his crew from an other part of the Citie, and girded in amongſt his enimies ſo hautely, that being troubled with the Elephantes before, and now ſo ſharpely aſſayled by the Conſul, they were eaſely ſuppreſſed, part being ſlaine, the reſt ſauing them ſelues by taking them to their héeles. There were ten Elephantes taken, with ten <hi>Indians,</hi> the reſt which had caſt downe their riders after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict were taken by the Conſuls. After this proſperous triumphe no ſmall praiſe was attribute to <hi>Metellus,</hi> the which by the confeſſion of euery man was the onely cauſe that the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers peaked not in mountaynes and hilles, but durſt in any plaine place ſkirmiſh with the <hi>Carthaginenſes.</hi> When the rumor of this victory was noyſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole Citie was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15198:60"/>
impleate with inexplicable gladneſſe, not onely bicauſe the Elephantes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, the enimies were much theyr inferiors, but bicauſe theyr ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were animated and imbolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Therefore as they had decréed in the beinning, they prepared an other nauie, and ſent it into <hi>Scicilye,</hi> being very deſirous to finiſh the warres.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing prepared viands and other neceſſaries, they paſſed the ſeas into <hi>Scicilye,</hi> with two hundreth ſhips. This was the fourtenth yeare of this warre.</p>
            <p>After their arriuall in the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Porte, the Conſuls tooke ſuche footemen as were in the prouince, and went to beſiege <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> for that Citie being ſubuerted, they hoped ſoone after to paſſe into <hi>Africae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> being moued alſo with the ſame reaſons, did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in any caſe to preſerue and kepe their munition from taking, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them ſelues to haue no tytle

to any thing in <hi>Scicilie,</hi> that being loſt, for all the reſidue of the prouince, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Drapanum</hi> was in ſubiection to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But leaſt thoſe things which I determine to intreate of in <hi>Scicilye,</hi> ſhold ſéeme difficult or obſcure to any vnacquainted with the places, I purpoſe briefly and in few words to declare the ſituation of the Iland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scicylie</hi> bordereth for the moſt parte vpon <hi>Italye,</hi> and the frontiers thereof, as <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> doeth vpon <hi>Grecia,</hi> and this is the chiefe difference betwixt them: <hi>Scicilye</hi> is ſeperate from <hi>Italye</hi> by an arme or créeke of the Sea, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponeſus</hi> from <hi>Grecia</hi> by a dry march or plot of ground, ſo that one may paſſe on foote from it into <hi>Grecia,</hi> but not from <hi>Scicilye</hi> into <hi>Italye,</hi> except they paſſe by water: in forme it reſembleth a triangle hauing at euery corner a promentary, of the which that borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring towards the ſoutherne clyme, ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the ſea of <hi>Scicilye,</hi> and is called <hi>Pachinus:</hi> that which exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth toward

In this prome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie there is a hill of the ſame name (at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante beſieged of the <hi>Romanes,)</hi> fortift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtrong walles, déepe ditches, perilous puddels, and many ſtanding waters, by which the porte is made very daungerous and perilous to be entered, except the Pilottes be very cunning and expert. The <hi>Romanes</hi> beſieging this Citie, enuironed it on eyther ſide with two campes, making many ditches, rampers, erecting ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry munitions, placing their engins, pretermitting nothing thought requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the expugnation of a holde: firſt they aſſaulted a towne which ſtoode in

the hyll ſide, bending towardes the <hi>African</hi> Sea, by all meanes that coulde be inuented, dayly inuenting new tormentes, continually ſetting them in places moſt conuenient.</p>
            <p>In continuaunce they ouerthrew ſixe Townes ſtanding nygh to yt, as with theyr whole power they were aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the walles.</p>
            <p>This ſiege was very ſharpe and mortall, the Citizens were ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraged &amp; oppreſſed with great feare and dread, for many of their towers and bulwarckes were very ruinous, being ſore rent and torne, and diuers turned ouer, and caſt to the grounde by theire Enimies: and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins damaged them dayly more and more.</p>
            <p>The number beſieged, amounted to aboue ten thouſand, beſide the greate multitude of inhabitantes. In thys theyr greuous diſtreſſe, <hi>Imilcon</hi> ruler of the Citie valyantly defended them from their enimies, continually réedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15198:62"/>
and making vp newe walles within the Cytie, where the <hi>Romans</hi> brake them with rammes and brakes, circumſpectly watching wher his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies made trenches, and by making other diſapointed them of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo that the ſubtil and ſlye ſlyghts of his aduerſaries were fruſtrate and of no effecte: oftentimes he iſſued out ſetting on them bothe by night and day, ſo that greater ſlaughter was made in thoſe byckerings, than in playne combate. At that tyme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the conducted Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lieutenaunts and ſergeants ouer the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> hoaſt, made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, intending to batray the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and being ayded with the conſente of theyr coparte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſkipped ouer the walles in the night, and came into the <hi>Romanes</hi> Campe, and declared theyr whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Conſul.</p>
            <p>There was at that tyme there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an <hi>Achaean,</hi> named <hi>Alexon,</hi> which

The Citizens of <hi>Carthage,</hi> though they could not heare tell how all things fared at <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> yet ſuſpecting them to be in diſtreſſe, bicauſe of the long ſiege, prepared fiftie ſhippes fraighted with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, ouer which Nauie they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted <hi>Annibal</hi> ſonne of <hi>Amilcar</hi> Captaine, giuing him certayne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations as the time permitted, commaunding that in any caſe with all celeritie he ſhould ſayle to <hi>Lilybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and ayde his countrie men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annibal</hi> with his Souldiers landed firſt at <hi>Eguſa,</hi> ſituate in the midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> from thence with a proſperous gaile, he entred the porte of the beſieged Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with hoyſted ſayles, hauing all his men in a redineſſe and prepared on the decke.

            <p>The multitude which were on the walles, perceiuing the preſence of their countrymen, trembled and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for very ioye, exhorting them with plauſible wordes and clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous noyſes to enter in boldely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annibal</hi> being of an incredyble au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacitie and hautie courage, puſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the porte valyantly, and withoute daunger or perill landed his men. Now when they were within the Towne, there was maruellous try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, not ſo much for the arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of the freſhe Souldiers, as by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Romanes</hi> durſt not trye to ſtoppe theyr paſſage. <hi>Imilcon</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all the army deſirous of battaile,

the olde ſouldiers being incoraged by the arriuall of the new ſuppliment, &amp; the new ſouldiers, bicauſe the thornes as yet had neuer pricked them, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it beſt not to pretermit that opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, indeuored him ſelf by all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes poſſible to get the engines of his enimies deſtroyed. Then he gathered all the army togither, and exhorted them with a long oration, imboldning theyr corages, promiſing great giftes to euery one that behaued him ſelfe valyantly, ſhewing the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> that they ſhould not be vnrewarded. The Souldiers were maruellouſly moued with his faire and pleaſaunt words, promiſing him that they wold be redy to theyr power, earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to lynger no longer, but euen at that inſtante to iſſue out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enimies. The Captaine thancking them for their good wylles, immediately diſmiſſed them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding that they ſhold go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them ſelues, and incontinently

to retourne and giue attendaunce on their Captaines to doe ſuche things as ſhold be appointed them. After that he called together the generalls, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them hys purpoſe, diſtributyng the armie amongſt them, appoynting euery one his place, and commaunded that they before all other in the fyrſt watche, ſhoulde be readie in their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which without grudging obeyed the commaundement of their graund captain. <hi>Imilcon</hi> hauing brought forth his power in the dawning, ſette vpon the ordinance of his enimies in diuers places.

in more danger: for amongſt a great companie of ſouldiers one man fought againſt an other, as though it had ben in a particular combate. But the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt and cruelleſt fight was about the ordinaunce: for they of bothe partes which were appointed to that warde, endeuored themſelues myghtily, the one part to ouerthrow, the other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, vntill ſuch time that the bata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

they were in greate daunger of loſing their ordinance, yet they reſiſted their enimies with ſuch incredible corage, that they preſerued them and al other things in ſafetie. After this <hi>Anniball</hi> departed with his puiſſance from <hi>Lily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beum,</hi> aboute the dead of the night, his enimies not knowyng, and paſſed to <hi>Adherball,</hi> the other <hi>Carthaginean</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaine, which laye at <hi>Drepanum,</hi> for which Citie they toke ſpeciall care, to kéepe it from the enimies, as well for the goodlineſſe of the towne, as for the commodiouſneſſe of the port: and it is diſtant from <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> but fiftene my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Now the captains were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſirous to know howe all things fared with their companions, but the entraunce was ſo narrowly watched ſince <hi>Annibals</hi> departure, that it was impoſſible for any man either to enter in or iſſue out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie.

The other Conſul won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering greatly at his bold enterpriſe, prepared ten of the ſwifteſt ſhippes to watche in the hauen all nyght, in the whiche he him ſelfe remained for his departure, commaundyng all the reſt of the Nauie to do accordingly. Then

After theſe things had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this eſtate a good while, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſodainly ſuch a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſtuous winde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; other thyngs were beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; daſhed together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15198:69"/>

The harder that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manes</hi> were beſtead with their myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunces, the more commodious was it for the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> purpoſe: for they not onely behelde their enimies, and the ordinaunce flaming aloft, but what ſoeuer they hurled at them, the winde caried it with maine violence to their great damage and hurt. At the length the fire waxed ſo outragious, that the pillers and foundations of the Toures were ſet on fire, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the rammes were melted.</p>
            <p>After this, the Conſuls neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to réedifie their engins, but enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned the towne with ditches and hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, purpoſing to take their enimies, with a ſlowe ſiege, and not to remoue their tents before they had ouercome the holde.

When relation was made at <hi>Rome,</hi> of theſe things ther was a Senate ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, in which they decréed to ſend a ſupplement of ten thouſande men, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many were deſtroyed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſiege, &amp; the nauy almoſt deſolate. This crew arriued firſt at <hi>Meſsana,</hi> &amp; from thence went by land to the campe at <hi>Lilybeu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Now was <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Conſulſhip, and the other retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that he ruled the hoſte at <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> and perceiuing the vacant places to be ſupplied, called the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains together, and ſhewyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be thought that a very expedient time to ſayle to <hi>Drepanum,</hi> and at an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares to ſet vpon <hi>Adherball,</hi> ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no ſuch thing: for not knowyng of the new ſupplement ariued in <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie,</hi> he ſuppoſed that the <hi>Romanes</hi> wer not able to conduct their fléete for lack of men. After that the Conſul had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed his minde, they allowed it very well, and picked oute the moſte actius Souldiers that were in the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,

and put them in the ſwifteſt ſhip. The Souldiers were very iocund and glad of this iourney, not only bicauſe it was nyghe hande, but alſo for the greate booties which they hoped for.</p>
            <p>Thus all things being prepared, they diſankred, and ſayled towarde <hi>Drepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> about midnight vnware to their enimies, ſo that in the dawning they drew nigh the Citie. <hi>Adherball</hi> though at their firſt apperance he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what daunted with ſodaine feare, yet being recouered, and receiuyng by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

not to encounter with him, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde of the great multitude, and he was ſo nigh, that they could not flye backe, wherefore he thruſte into very daungerous places, and retyred to the next harboure, decréeing rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer extreme perill, than to permit the <hi>Romane</hi> Nauie, to fall into their Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies handes.

paſſages, which are very difficill to this place, two from the land, and one from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sea. <hi>Amilcar</hi> pitched his tents there, as a man deſperate and of no hope, in the midſt of his enimies, yet he permitted not his aduerſaries to be in quiet, but ofte times went by Sea, and waſted the coaſtes of <hi>Italye,</hi> to <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> and in the ende brought his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by lande, where he encamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Panormus,</hi> but eight hundreth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diſtante from the <hi>Romans,</hi> remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there thrée yeares, during which tyme he did many notable actes, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to rehearſe particularly. The <hi>Romanes</hi> as is ſhewed before, lying in two parts, one company at the top, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at the foote of <hi>Erix, Adherbal</hi> by pollycie wonne the Towne which ſtode on the hill ſide, betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Armies, by which chaunce the <hi>Romanes</hi> which laye on the top, were beſieged and ſore moleſted with the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> and they them ſelues likewiſe keping the Towne, were as

ſore beſet with the two Armies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but one entrance, and that very ſtraite for the conueyance of victuals into the Towne. Thus both the parts perſiſting in their obſtinacie and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe, ſuffred diuerſe puniſhments, greuous tortours, and extreme cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myties. When the warre in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hadde ben long protracte, during which time <hi>Amilcar</hi> plaged the <hi>Italy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ofte times by water, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte for the ſpace of fiftene yeares, had abſtained from the Naual warre, but now perceiuing that the warre could not otherwiſe be ended, they were moued to prepare a new nauie. And bicauſe theyr treaſury was ſore impoueriſhed, the priuate Citizens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilitie, diſburſed the money, diuers of them making one Quinquereme amongſt them. Thus were the people of <hi>Rome</hi> affected to further their warres, and mayntaine the Glory of their Empire, building two hundreth ſhippes, like to the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>

this conflict differed in all points from that at <hi>Drepanum,</hi> ſo likewiſe, there chanced a contrary ende.

The <hi>Africans</hi> though they were very prompt, and giuen to the warres, yet after this terrible ouerthrow, they were vtterly diſcoraged for diuerſe cauſes, for they were not able toayde thoſe in <hi>Scicilie</hi> with neceſſaries, their nauie being loſte, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling euery corner of the ſeas, yet they toke it for a haynous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to forſake their worthy Souldiers: they had no worthy Captaines to ſende againſte their Enimies.

with proude boaſts, &amp; much more they dyd before, being mindfull of the great gifts promiſed by their captains when they exhorted them to battaile, ſo that nowe they looked for ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes beſide their ſtipends: but their opinion was fruſtrate, for as ſoone as all the companie were congregated in <hi>Sicca, <hi>Hanno</hi>
               </hi> the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> Pretor was ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them, not only without the gifts which they loked, for but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo talked very much of the ſcarcitie in the treaſure houſe, requiring them to remit part of their wages. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude moued with theſe words began a great vprore and a clamorous noiſe.

other of a ſet purpoſe and malice, ſo that nothyng was in the hoſte but wrath, anger and ruffling vp &amp; downe with many miſcheuous and wycked factes. Amongeſt other thinges they murmured and complained, bycauſe none of the Captaines vnder whome they had warred in <hi>Scicilie,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them the great rewardes, were ſent to them, and at the length in gret rage and anger they fell to their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nothing regarding <hi>Hanno,</hi> or the other captains: and ſetting towardes <hi>Carthage,</hi> they encamped at <hi>Tunes,</hi> fiue miles diſtaunt from the Citie.

with the other traficke in the Citie to ſerue for hoſtages, if néede required.

The moſt raſcal and ſeditious knaues wer of greateſt authoritie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armie.

<pb facs="tcp:15198:88"/>
wiſhyng them after that (with a long oration) to worſhip, loue, fauour and haue the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> in eſtimation, in whoſe ſeruice they had bene ſo long time, perſuading and exhorting them to be content with their wages, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myning to diſtribute it by nations.</p>
            <p>There was in the hoſt a certain <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane,</hi> which being a ſeruant, fled out of <hi>Scicilie</hi> from the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes,</hi> a man of greate ſtrength and courage in battaile, named <hi>Spendius:</hi> This felow was afrayd, if peace ſhold be concluded wyth the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> that his maiſter would catch him, and handle hym according to the <hi>Romane</hi> lawes, wherfore he labored with tooth and naile to kindle diſſention, wiſhing rather ſedition than quietneſſe, warre than peace. There was alſo an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> named <hi>Matho,</hi> whiche was a frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and hadde bene in the <hi>Scicilian</hi> warres for the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> yet hée feared puniſhement, bycauſe hee was chiefe of the ſedition.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15198:88"/>
callyng the <hi>Africanes</hi> together, counſelled them to be ware, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other ſouldiers had receiued their wages, and were gone, he ſayd that the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> woulde wreake them ſelues of the <hi>Libians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that they were chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of rebellion: And for this cauſe he wiſhed them to take héede of them ſelues. The multitude beyng moued with theſe wordes, and bicauſe <hi>Geſto</hi> made onely mention of their wages, ſpeakyng nothyng of recompence for their horſſes, neither of the required grain, they gathered into one place to determine of the mater. <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> inueyed ſore againſt <hi>Geſto,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other <hi>Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes,</hi> &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyſone agréed to their wicked purpoſe, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any counſelled them otherwiſe, they neuer regarded whether it tended to the ſame end or no, but immediately ſtoned him to death.

and nothyng was hearde in thys tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe thoroughe the whole hoſte, but caſt caſt: and the vagabunds raged a greate deale more, being newe riſen from ſupper wel tippled, ſo that if this worde Caſt, chaunced once to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the ſtones were ſo ratled in euery corner, that there was no place to eſcape by.</p>

For as a botche if you laye any healyng medicine to cure it, when it begynneth to féele the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; vertue of the medicine, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, likewiſe if you neglect and take no regard of it, it augmenteth muche more of the propre nature, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth it til ſuch time as the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die be corrupt: ſemblable reſtauration and corruptions chance to the minde: ſo that no other brute beaſte is made more cruel, fierce or outragious, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more wilde or beſtial than a man if you grant him libertie and fréedom:

if you handle hym beningly or gently he thinketh you goe aboute to deceiue him, ſo that you are worſe truſted for your benefite beſtowed: contrarywiſe if you take agaynſt him, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo hurtfull or noyſome, which he wyll not aſſay, ſuppoſyng it to turne to his great praiſe, while he ſlides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuche brutiſheneſſe, that he cleane forſaketh the Nature of a man, which hath the beginning of corrupte man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and ſiniſtre education in the nonage.

            <p>While this brewing was yet in tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, <hi>Amilcar</hi> ſente for <hi>Hanno,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Carthaginean</hi> captain, ſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> armies being knit together to end the warre ſooner, and all the priſoners which he had either there, or caughte afterwardes, he caſt to be deuoured of

Now the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> were in good hope, and feared not the warrs, but fortune altered ſodainely, and tourned their matters quite contrarie: for as ſoone as the two capitaines were aſſociate, there ingendred ſuch a rancor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt them, that they not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted to inuade their ennimies, but offered occaſions that their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries might aſſaile them. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes</hi> being moued with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, commanded that one of them ſhoulde returne into the Citie, and the other which the Souldiers woulde, to remaine with the hoſte.

that were determined, ſuppoſed the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> to haue betrayed them, wherefore incontinently they armed them, thinking to defend them ſelues in an angle of their tentes, but <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> marching againſte them with his Elephants and other of his hoſt, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched and killed them, euery one being in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber aboue forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nigh to a place called <hi>Serra,</hi> taking the denomination of the Carpenters inſtrument, called a Saw. Thus the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> which a lyttle before were in diſpaire of their ſafegard and helth, began to receiue a good courage, hoping to be reduced to their priſtinat eſtate. <hi>Amilcar</hi> with <hi>Nerua</hi> and <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> ceaſed not to wander and forage abrode in the countrey, ſo that many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Africans</hi> reuolted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; diuers Cities yelded willingly. Then they brought their hoſte to <hi>Tunes,</hi> inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to beſiege <hi>Matho</hi> and his accomplices. <hi>Annibal</hi> pitched his tents on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſide of the towne which is towards <hi>Carthage</hi>

and <hi>Amilcar</hi> on the oppoſite. They brought with them <hi>Spendius</hi> and the other which they had taken, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them all in the ſight of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. When <hi>Amilcar</hi> was departed to his ſtation, <hi>Matho</hi> perceiuing <hi>Annibal</hi> to come into his tentes with his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers verie raſhly, thought it not beſt to pretermit ſuch an oportunitie, but iſſued out againſt the <hi>Carthaginenſes,</hi> &amp; toke many of them, compelling the reſt to returne, ſacking their tentes, &amp; carying away their ſtuffe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate <hi>Annibal</hi> the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> captain was taken aliue, &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently led to the gallowes of <hi>Spendius,</hi> where they toke and hanged vp <hi>Annibal,</hi> &amp; murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thirtie noble men of <hi>Carthage,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the dead corps of <hi>Spendius,</hi> ſo that fortune declined equally to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, giuing them time to be reuenged of their enimies. <hi>Amilcar</hi> being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to late of this vnhappie chaunce, could not helpe them, the plot was ſo impaſſible, wherfore he remoued from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15198:106"/>
               <hi>Tunes,</hi> and brought his armie to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Machera,</hi> where he encamped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> banke.

Then they ſent their Senatours legates to <hi>Amilcar</hi> which led with them <hi>Hanno,</hi> and a new crew of men, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that in any caſe they ſhould take vp the olde rancor &amp; debate that was betwixt him and <hi>Amilcar,</hi> which being vnited together, ſhoulde with one minde indeuour them ſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer theyr ennimies, willing them to way the cruelty of that time, wyth the neceſſitie and apparaunt daunger the Citie was in.</p>
            <p>The Senatours called the captains together, then after many and ſundry exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſmothered &amp; repreſſed the cankered ſedition, reconcyling &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedient to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Then afterwardes all things were ruled by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two captaines, ſo that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt <hi>Matho,</hi> after many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both at <hi>Leptis</hi> &amp; other places, they appointed to pitch a fielde and fight it out with their enimies, to which both parts came coragiouſly, gathering the friends &amp; allies out of euery corner, ſending for them which were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to defend the cities, knowing that in this battaile one parte ſhould win the ſpurres. After that bothe armies had prepared all things belonging to the battaile, and were ready, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly inuaded on the other: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile was maruellous cruell, rigorous and mortall, but the <hi>Carthaginenſes</hi> in the ende obtained the victorie. The moſte part of their Enimies were ſlaine in fight, the reſt fled to a little Citie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent, which yelded immediatly. So that onely <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> and <hi>Hippona,</hi> perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their obſtinacie, acknowledging their wickedneſſe, hoping of no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for their facinorous crime, by which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15198:107"/>
we may learne a modeſt meane to be of much efficacie, and that it is better to pill ſtraws, than to worke ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious geare and crafty conueyaunces, that in the ende the ſame is intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But at the laſte, <hi>Amilcar</hi> &amp; <hi>Hanno</hi> incamping about them, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to yelde, &amp; agree to all ſuch things as pleaſed the <hi>Carthaginenſes.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this maner was the <hi>African</hi> warre ended, in which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had ſuch proſperous ſucceſſe, that they not onely obtained all <hi>Africa,</hi> but alſo executed condign puniſhment vpon the rebelles. <hi>Matho</hi> &amp; his copes mates were led about the towne with the youth of the Citie for a triumph, &amp; then put to paines worthy of their wickedneſſe. This war endured thrée yeares and foure monethes, far exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other in crueltie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that euer I heard of. About that time the <hi>Romans</hi> were allured by the perſuaſions of the ſouldiers that fled out of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> to tranſfrete into the

Henry Chickley Archbishop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which Oration I red ouer, and at the ende a replye to the ſame, made by the right honorable Lorde <hi>Rafe,</hi> earle of Weſtmerlande, a man of no leſſe grauitie than experience, which was garniſhed with ſuch floures of Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, and matter of importance, that if it had ben in <hi>Greke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> it had ben nothing inferiour, but equiualent with the Orations of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Tully.</hi> When I had taken a ſuperficial ſight of it, I was rapte in minde more profoundly to digeſt his ſtately ſtile knit together as the Ambre, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes indiſſoluble as the Adamant. After that I had circumſpectly ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and wayed it with deliberation, I wondered not a little to ſée ſuch elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and pithie ſentences procede out from ſuch a potentate as ſcant in theſe our dayes demane from graue &amp; great learned Doctors. There lacked no copie of examples, as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Africans,</hi> the <hi>Grekes</hi> and eſpecially
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15198:110"/>
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by diuerſe other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea of Englande and Scotlande. When I had peruſed the mellifluous Oration of this worthy Oratour and mightie magiſtrate, I determyned with my ſelfe to reade ſome of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hiſtories, out of which he had picked ſuch pleaſant pearles, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before the reſt that Hiſtorie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of the warres made by the <hi>Romans</hi> for <hi>Scicilie,</hi> and the Citie of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> out of the which he hadde col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the moſt firme &amp; infringible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes of his Oration. With the peruſing of the which Hiſtory, I was ſo rapt and pleaſured, that my appal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſenſes were quickned, and my dul wit ſharpened &amp; reuiued. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which cauſes I vowed to apply my vacant houres in reducing it to our maternal &amp; vulgar tong, vnder the protection &amp; gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt worthy ſequele &amp; hautie ſucceſſours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incomparable Earle, truſting ſo much to their bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; accuſtomed ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes, which naturally is pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtock, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:15198:111"/>
that they would gratefully accept my good wil towards them. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was come to this point, I thought that of neceſſitie I muſt nedes pen the oration which was the originall cauſe of this my tranſlation, that thereby I might ſatiſfie them which were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know for what cauſe I toke this worke in hand, which could not be done without declaring of the biſhops which was the cauſe of the earls. So then I was perſuaded, that euery man would be deſirous to know for what cauſe the biſhop made his, which could not be ſhewed without entring into the life of King Henry, the which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of his life would haue cauſed him to haue ben iudged of ſome maligne &amp; curſed perſons, a wicked prince. But for their confounding which would go about to take ſuch a cauſe where none is offered, I iudged it as a thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, at the leaſte compendiouſly to ſhew this abſtract, of the life of our worthy and renoumed prince and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15198:111"/>
not neding any argelier to explicate &amp; ſet forth his workes, bothe bicauſe I ſhould ſoner emptie the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans, and fill the vorages of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis,</hi> than ſhew his merited prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are done alredy, as worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be by any man, (in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two illuſtre and noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Lancaſter and Yorke, compiled by the forenamed <hi>Hal)</hi> but yet not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they ought to haue ben, or as he deſerued, and alſo bicauſe this may ſufficiently ſerue for the vnderſtanding of that which I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.

This King was the man which (according to the auncient prouerbe) declared &amp; ſhewed, that honour ought
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15198:112"/>
to chaunge maners: for incontinently after that he was inthroniſed in the ſiege royall, and had receiued the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem and ſcepter of this famous and fortunate region, he determined with him ſelfe to put on the ſhape of a new man, &amp; to vſe an other ſort of liuing, turning inſolency &amp; wildeneſſe, into grauitie and ſoberneſſe, and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vice into conſtant vertue: and to the entent that he would ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte without reflection, either leaſt he ſhould bée allured by the ſiniſter perſuaſions of his familyer compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, with whome he had paſſed his adoleſcencie in wanton paſtimes and ryotous rufflings, he banyſhed and ſeparated from him, all his olde flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and lighte bolde braineſicke playféeres, but not vnrewarded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting them from thence forth on a great payne, not once to approche eyther to his ſpeach, or preſence, nor yet to lodge or ſoiourne within ten miles of his highe Courte, or royall
<pb facs="tcp:15198:113"/>
manſion, and in their places elected &amp; choſe men of grauitie and great wit, with ſuch as were practiſed in pollicie and martial prowes, by whoſe ſkilful wiſdome, curious counſayle, prudent pollicies, and ingenious inſtructions, he might at all times rule regally, to his high honour, &amp; guide his gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce princelike to his profit. This péer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe prince was righteouſly reported to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rare Arabical <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and the very Peragone of his predeceſſours.</p>
            <p>This haughty <hi>Henry</hi> was a King, whoſe life was exempt from al faults, &amp; his liuing vnſpotted with obloquie, this curtuous king was a princely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, whome all men leally loued &amp; none diſdained or dreade: this prewe Prince was a coragious Captaine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whome fickle Fortune neuer fraudulently frowned, nor irous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce once ſpitefully ſpurned: this warlike Captaine was a ſincere ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, whome his fawning flocke faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fauored, and obediently obeyed,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15198:113"/>
and with continuall acclamations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their louing lorde. Thys our paſtor was ſuch a iuſt iuſticiarie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no facinorous fact was pretermitted vnpuniſhed, or faithfull frendſhyp de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of due deſert. This gentle Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticiarie was ſo vnfaynedlye feared, that all rage and rebellion were quite baniſhed, and all ſedition ſuppreſſed. His ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertues were no more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than his fine qualities wer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe, for the whiche fewe or none were to him comparable. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could be found more temperate in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking than he was, he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no frugalitie, his diet was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate dainties, but rather rurall and groſſe, more to be deſired of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried warrier than to be offred to amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ladies. Hys indomable courage was ſo conſtant, and his hearte was ſo immutable, that he reiected al feare and daſtardly dread from him was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly baniſhed. He had ſuch profound knowledge in conducting and ordring
<pb facs="tcp:15198:114"/>
an armie, and ſuche a rare grace in the incoraging of his ſouldiers, that fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch men publikely pronounced him to bée inuincible and impoſſible to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. Hée was endued with ſuche pregnant wyt, ſuch perfecte prudence and admirable policie, that he neuer enterpriſed any thing before he hadde diligently debated it, and circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſene all ſuch meane chances as might happen. And when the end was concluded, with al celeritie &amp; courage, he furthered his pretence &amp; purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Wonder it is to heare, how he being a potentate of honor, a prince of youth, a Kyng of riches, and extract of ſo hautie a familie, didde continually abſtaine from laſciuious lyuing and blynde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, yea in the time of ſiniſter chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he was no more dolent than in the time of victorie, the which conſtancie fewe men haue or can vſe. Such a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtomacke had he, and ſuch a graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was ingrauen in the bottome of his heart. What politike practiſes and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15198:114"/>

In the which bolde battaile he victoriouſly vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, with a ſmall power of oure En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhe ſouldiers inſuperable, the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of <hi>France,</hi> faſt buckled with boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on their barbed horſes, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſharpe ſpeares and funerall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in their vnhautie hands: alſo the bolde <hi>Britains</hi> with fiery handgunnes, and ſlaſhing ſwords, with the practiſed <hi>Pickards,</hi> which caried ſtrong &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Croſbowes, beſide the fierce brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick <hi>Brabanders,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Almayns,</hi> with their long puſhing pykes, by his
<pb facs="tcp:15198:115"/>
prudent policies, he ſodainly ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theſe, in the which combat, the ſworde deuoured aboue ten thouſande perſons, wherof were princes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles bearing banners a hundreth ſixe and twentie, all the remnant ſixtene hundreth excepte, were Knightes, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers, and Gentlemen, ſo that of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men and high blood wer ſlain eight thouſande and foure hundreth of the <hi>Gallician</hi> armie. And in thys furious battaile onely fiue or ſixe hundreth of our Engliſh armie, with two or thrée of the nobilitie were exempt from the fruition (with eternall glorie) of this incomparable terrene triumph. Thys conflict may be a notorious mirroure and gaſing glaſſe to all chriſten Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to behold and folow, and alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable teſtimonie and atteſtation of the worthie acts perpetrate by our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous King <hi>Henry,</hi> the engliſh <hi>Hector,</hi> which was the blaſing comete and gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering lanterne of his days. He was the mirrour of Chriſtendome, and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15198:115"/>
glorie of hys countreye. Hée was the floure of kings paſſed, &amp; a ſeing glaſſe to ſuch as ſhould ſuccede. No emperor ſurmounted him in magnanimitie, no potentate was more piteous or lorde more bounteous, no Kyng had leſſe of his ſubiectes, and neuer King conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amplier dominions, whoſe fame by hys death as liuely flouriſheth, as his acts in this life were ſéene and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, hée was the ſcourge of the Frenchmen, and continually abated and appalled their courages: yet he neuer putte confidence in hys owne ſtrength, neither in the puiſſaunce of his people, nor in the fortitude of hys champions, neither yet in the ſtrength of his barbed horſes, or any whitte in his owne policie. But he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God to be the onely cauſe and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of theſe his heape of renoumes and victorious conqueſts, in whom he put his whole confidence hope &amp; truſt, vpon whom he ſtedfaſtly ancored and firmely cleaued vnto in all his daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb facs="tcp:15198:116"/>
as to an immouable rock or ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt corner ſtone. And he which neuer leaueth them deſtitute that put theyr truſt in him, remunerated his firme fayth, with many glorious and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaunt victories, of the whiche ſome might almoſt be thought incredible, if we had not red in the booke of Kings, that God likewiſe had defended them that put their affiance in him, and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted them ſelues wholly to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance. This worthie Peragon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt all gouernours, remembred that a King ought to rule with witte, grauitie, circumſpection, diligence &amp; conſtancie: and for that cauſe to haue a rule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, not as an honor, but for an onerarious charge and quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an carefulneſſe, not to looke ſo muche on other mens liuing, as ſeriouſly to conſider and intentiuely reuolue hys own propre acts and doings, for which cauſe he not ſo muche truſting to the redineſſe of his owne capacitie, nor to the iudgement of his owne wauering
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15198:116"/>
will, called to hys Counſell ſuch pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and politike perſonages as ſhold not onely helpe to illeuate and ſuſtein his charge, in ſupportyng the burdeyn of his realme and empire, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and inſtructe him with ſuch good reaſons and fruitful perſuaſions, that he mighte ſhewe hym ſelfe a ſingular mirrour ano manifeſt example of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues and good qualities, vnto hys common people, and louyng ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.</p>
            <p>After that he had layde thys prudente and politike foundation, he intended in his minde to do many noble and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actes, and remembryng that all goodneſſe commeth of God, and that all worldly things and humaine actes be more weaker and poorer than the celeſtiall powers &amp; heauenly rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, determined to begyn wyth ſome thing which ſhold be pleaſant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God.

            <p>After this Oration of the worthye Earle, the Duke of Exceſter roſe vp and ſpake an other, in the which he per ſuaded the Kings Maieſtie to take in hande the conqueſt of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but not without attributing great laude and praiſe to the Oration of the Earle, but eſpecially he commended the entrance of his confirmation, in the which hée had alleaged howe the <hi>Romanes</hi> more deſired ſuch as wer vnder the flight of their owne Egle, or whoſe poſſeſſions were a moate to their eyes, as the Ile of <hi>Scicilie,</hi> and the Citie of the <hi>Samni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and other, which he clearkly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than other regions farre diſtant, and not obiect to their horizon. But by them he nothing preuailed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15198:134"/>
ſo muche regarded the ſayings of hys vncle, that incontinently he ſent hym and others ambaſſadors to the French King. And ſhortly after hauing furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his nauie with all things fitte for ſuch a royall voyage, yet beyng mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the wordes which his true and loyall péere, the Erle of Weſtmerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a faithfull <hi>Codrus</hi> toward his countrey had ſpoken, he apointed him as a moſt worthie champion, and one in whome he had fixed great hope and confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with the Lorde Scrope and other dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hardie perſonages, valiant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and worthy warriers to defend the marches and frontiers adioyning to <hi>Scotland,</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they dyd many hauty and valiant enterpriſes.

After this the Kyng made

an other voyage into <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> for certain wrongs offred vnto him, &amp; purſued the Dolphin, in ſuch wiſe, that he coulde ſcant find <hi>Hiempſalles</hi> hole to hyde him ſelf in. Thus after many victorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> queſts vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Frenchmen, this floure of chiualry paſſing to aide them of <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> whiche were beſieged by the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins adherents, came to <hi>Corbell,</hi> &amp; ſo to <hi>Senleſſe,</hi> where whether it were through the heate of the ayre, or dayly labour, being ſore féebled &amp; weakened, he began to waxe ſicke, yea and ſo ſick that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to deſiſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pretenſed purpoſe, and ſende the duke of Bedford his brother to perform his iorney and enterpriſe.

<pb facs="tcp:15198:136"/>
moſt heartie thankes, chiefly for that he woulde call him out of this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, at ſuch a time when as he was of moſt perfect remembrance both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God and the worlde, and alſo in the time of his flouriſhing conqueſt, in whiche he had neuer receiued miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, euil chaunce or ſpot of diſhonor, affirming that he was bothe glad, and inwardly reioyced, bicauſe the ſhorte tyme and ſmall tracte of hys mortall lyfe ſhoulde bee a teſtimonie of hys ſtrength, a declaration of his Iuſtice, and a ſetting forth of his acts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings, alſo that by his death he ſhold obteine fame, glorie and renoume, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capyng the reprehenſion of coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the moate of all infamie, which by chance he might haue gotten, if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had prolonged his life. Saying as eternitie is the triumpher of time, ſo he truſted after this fragile &amp; caduce life, to obteine eternall being: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this miſerable pilgremage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the celeſtiall kingdome, &amp; to come
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15198:136"/>
to the place of reſt &amp; quietneſſe. Thus committing his ſoule to God, his yong ſonne prince <hi>Henry</hi> to his nobles, his loue to his frends, and his bodie to the earth, he ſayd certaine godly pſalmes, and receiued the bleſſed communion, afterward reciting the Pſalme of the Paſſion, he completed and expyred his fatall breth, the laſt day of Auguſt, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare of our Lord, a thouſand foure hundreth twentie &amp; two, in the ninth yeare, the fift moneth, and twentie &amp; fourth daye of his raigne, the eight &amp; thirty yeare of his age. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of this Doctour in Martial affaires, &amp; of all cheualry, the very peragon, was publiſhed among the common people, incontinently their hearts were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled, their courages abated, &amp; their dolour much encreaſed, yea their wits were ſo troubled, that like mad men they tare their haire, accuſing and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Fortune, which had bereft them of ſo rare a iewel, for robbing them of ſo noble an ornament, and defacing
<pb facs="tcp:15198:137"/>
them of ſo ſure a defence, and for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their ſtrong bulwarke. Thus this worthie King dyed of a pleuriſey, which at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time was a rare ſickneſſe, and ſtrange diſeaſe: for the name was to the moſt part of men vnknowne, &amp; Phiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were little acquainted with any remedie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: his bodie was imbaumed, cloſed in lead, &amp; laide in a royal Chariot, ſumptuouſly adourned with cloth of golde. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the corps was laide a liuely repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation of his proper perſon, beſet with robes, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme and ſcepter, with ball, &amp; other abilime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts apperteining to a King, the which chariot was drawn with braue Courſers, gorgiouſly trapped in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall armes, accompanied with diuers dolent mourners. Thus with great funerall pompe, his body was conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Boys de Vincence</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Roan,</hi> from thence to <hi>Abinell,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to <hi>Caleis,</hi> then to <hi>Douer,</hi> and ſo through the citie of London to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, where he was enterred with

ſuch ſolemne ceremonies, ſuch mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Lordes, ſuch prayers of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, &amp; ſuch lamenting of commons, as neuer before that day was ſéene in England.
